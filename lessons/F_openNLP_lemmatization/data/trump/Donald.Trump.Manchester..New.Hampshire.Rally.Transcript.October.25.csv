"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Thank you. What a group. What a group. We love this place. This was my first victory, right? This was our first victory. Remember that beautiful primary that we had and Trump came in and Trump won this incredible great state and it was off to the races, right? Off to the races. So I want to thank you and hello, New Hampshire. It’s great to be with you on this beautiful, on this beautiful day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","02:00"
"Donald Trump","Nine days from now, we are going to win the state. Can you believe it? Nine days. And we’re going to win four more great years in the White House. We’re going to keep it going. This is the most important election in the history of our country, the most important election.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","02:40"
"Donald Trump","And I never thought I’d say it after what we went through with the last one four years ago, this is a more important election because we’re fighting people that we’ve got to end it. We’ve got to end the fight. We’ve got to put them down. We’ve got to end the fight. Our country will never be a socialist country. We have to end the fight once and for all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","03:02"
"Donald Trump","For the last half century sleepy Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in the endless, horrible, ridiculous foreign wars. Afghanistan, 19 years, 19 years. He voted for the war in Iraq. But for himself, did you know today? You know what happened, right? He put the lid on. You know what the lid is? He’s constantly putting the lid on, constantly putting the lid on.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","03:27"
"Donald Trump","The lid means, I guess it’s referring to a garbage can, right? You put the lid. And he’s putting the lid on. This guy has more lids. I don’t know. There’s something going on. Somebody said it’s strategy. It’s not not, because really strategy would be coming out. And by the way, a lot of things are happening lately. You been noticing? Have you been noticing?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","03:58"
"Donald Trump","I just was asking some people to go back to the fake news and go to the back of the plane. A lot of people up there, a lot of cameras. And I was saying, ” And I wish those cameras would show behind the cameras.” There were thousands of people there, thousands of people there, and thousands of people outside on the street, thousands.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","04:19"
"Donald Trump","There are thousands of people outside. But have you been noticing what’s been happening? People know we’ve done a great job. What’s going to happen? This is going to be as exciting, maybe, I don’t know, you can say more exciting. You remember that beautiful night in November four years ago? Well, I don’t think this one will be as close. I don’t think this is going to be as close. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","04:44"
"Crowd","We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you. We love you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","05:13"
"Donald Trump","No, that’s a chant. In all fairness, I said, “Has anyone in the history of politics,” think about it, Ronald Reagan was popular, but they never had that chant. That is a chant. I won’t even say it because I don’t want to cry, but Ronald Reagan never had that chant. Nobody’s ever had that chant, and you see what we go through. It’s a tough thing. The swamp is deep and it’s vicious. These people are vicious. These people don’t report the truth. It’s very hard. They don’t report the truth. So for instance, I asked them, “Would you please turn the cameras around?” They don’t do that. They never do. They have this shot all the time. I don’t have that big an ego. I don’t want that shot. They have this shot. You know what they show? They show myself and about five people back there. And on occasion, some of the people back there become big stars because they are on camera.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","05:28"
"Donald Trump","But they never move the camera, and I used to think it was the way it is. You couldn’t move it, mechanically you couldn’t do it. And then all of a sudden, we don’t see that anymore. I shouldn’t say it, but we don’t see it anymore. They used to have little fights, right? Little problem. And the camera used to turn like a pretzel to catch it because they viewed that as a bad thing, right, a bad thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","06:35"
"Donald Trump","And that camera would turn around. That steel would turn like there’s nothing to it, but they never show the crowds. But you know what? They don’t show Biden’s crowd when seven people show up. And you know what? They don’t show Barack Hussein Obama. He came out to campaign two days ago. Right? And they had 42 people. He drew flies. Did you ever hear the expression? Obama drew flies.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","06:56"
"Donald Trump","But they don’t show that. But we want them to show our crowds because there’s never been anybody, and this is us as a group, anybody, any group, any movement that’s ever gotten the kind of crowds that we have. And I was told about New Hampshire. I have a lot of friends that live up here, but I understand New Hampshire. I was told in New Hampshire, you can’t have big crowds. You have to go to everybody’s dining room and have dinner with them. This was even as I was campaigning. I said, “I’m sorry. It just doesn’t work. You got to get together and all.” And you have guys, they have nothing much to do. They’re politicians, and they’ll go and have dinner with two or three people every night. And they’ll do this for years. And then they come in seventh in the primary or something.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","07:29"
"Donald Trump","I said, “No, we got to do this.” And we’ve been doing this from the beginning. You have the good arena that holds a lot of people, and we pack that all the time. But now with the COVID, what we do, and they keep talking about cases. You know why we have cases so much? Because that’s all we do is test.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","08:20"
"Donald Trump","If we cut our testing down in half, they’d say, well, they wouldn’t say that, but cases would go down. No, we have the best testing and we are coming around. We’re rounding the turn. We have the vaccines. We have everything. We’re rounding the turn. Even without the vaccines we’re rounding the turn. It’s going be over.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","08:36"
"Donald Trump","And you know who got it? I did. Can you believe it? Every time I’d have these meetings, a lot of people, because I can’t put myself in a basement for the next year and a half. Okay? I can’t do it. No I can’t. Or I can’t go to a beautiful bedroom in the White House and lock myself up for a year and a half. You’re president. You have to do your job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","08:57"
"Donald Trump","And I’d have meetings and I’d leave meetings, and I’d leave a meeting, and I’d say, “That wasn’t good.” A lot of people and there’s a lot of love in the rooms a lot of times. A lot of times there’s no love at all, just the opposite. But I’d say, “That might not be good,” but you got to do your job. And I went and what they do is incredible. The doctors are incredible, and especially when you’re president, because you have more doctors.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","09:17"
"Donald Trump","I don’t know if I could ever get used to this again, going back to a normal where you actually have one doctor. You have a doctor for every single part of your body. It’s true. And they want to touch it, too. They want to grab you. ” Sir, I’m a specialist in this. Could I check this?” I said, “I’d prefer not.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","09:44"
"Donald Trump","But I didn’t feel good and wonderful doctors. Sean, White House doctors, terrific. They’re all really talented people, but I had 12 of them, literally 12. Johns Hopkins. I had doctors from the best schools, the best hospitals in the world because you’re president, right? And I said, “I’m not feeling too good, fellows. What are we going to do here?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","10:07"
"Donald Trump","And the following morning, I took something called Regeneron. The following morning, I felt so good. I felt like Superman. I wanted to get back. I didn’t want to cancel anything.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","10:28"
"Crowd","Super Trump. Super Trump. Super Trump. Super Trump. Super Trump. Super Trump.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","10:50"
"Donald Trump","Now we didn’t want to be canceling. We didn’t want to be canceling a lot of things, right? Like Biden. I mean, I don’t know what the hell’s wrong with him. He never goes anywhere. And when he does, it’s Delaware. Now, I like Delaware too. But he just wants to say right next to that house. He feels very uncomfortable. Yesterday, he did some kind of a crazy rally with the horns, right? And then the camera made a terrible mistake. The guy’s going to get fired, I’m sure, because the camera turned around and there were so few, there was nobody there. And then he got very agitated, right? You saw that, because you know who was there? Our people were there. Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","10:56"
"Donald Trump","And they were screaming and he can’t think too well. He was having a hard time. And he got very angry. And Obama got angry too, because he went out someplace and it was all our people. And today they’re having this incredible rally on long Island. What’s happened to New York is so sad with the crime. Democrat run. Only Democrat run. Where you have Democrat run, you have problems. You have crime. It’s all closed up in many cases, locked down, locked down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","11:39"
"Donald Trump","By the way, you have an excellent governor here, right? You have an excellent governor. Can I say that? Good. Sometimes I’ll say that and people don’t like it, but you do. You have a good governor, good guy, and he’s with us. And the family is good. And his father is great. His father, I’d see that name Sununu. I said, “Man, he was brutal. He was tough.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","12:08"
"Donald Trump","And once we won, there was nobody better than him. There was nobody rougher and there was nobody better. But it’s a good family. They really are. They’ve done a good job and you’re opened up and you’re doing business and here we are, here we are. But Biden has the lid on again. I guess he figures if he keeps the lid on, he’s not going to make a stupid statement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","12:29"
"Donald Trump","He made one yesterday. Yesterday he said, “I’m getting tired of smart people.” No, you got to like smart people. Right? He said that, then he said something much worse. Right? He talked about the fact that we have the most corrupt. He didn’t mean that. They didn’t mean that. But I think maybe we’ll put a clip up. We have a new deal. Oh, there it is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","12:51"
"Donald Trump","See that little screen? That costs a lot of money. And if we like you, like we do the great state of New Hampshire, if we like you, like we do New Hampshire, we put that up and we have a couple of little clips, like he’s against social security, little things like that. How about his oil comment?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","13:15"
"Donald Trump","And I said, “It took all the way to the end. He was doing okay. I wouldn’t say it was Winston Churchill, but he was doing all right. He was getting through it.” And then all of a sudden it came out, the oil, and he wants to transition. He wants a transition. I said, “Okay, are you listening, Texas? Are you listening, Pennsylvania?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","13:35"
"Donald Trump","Actually, are you listening? You know why? Because your bills. Because of New York, you have the highest energy bills in the country, New Hampshire, all of new England, because they won’t allow, we’re going to do it anyway, but they won’t allow a pipeline to go through New York up to new England. You know that, right? And because of that, and all it would do is cause jobs because upstate New York has been an economic disaster under Cuomo and people are leaving.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","13:57"
"Donald Trump","But think of it. A pipeline that nobody would see, way underground, would reduce your energy costs by 50, 60, 70%. And Governor Cuomo won’t allow it. So we’re having a little bit of a dispute, and this should’ve been done years ago. I get stuck with everything. I get stuck. But we’ll get it done, we’ll get it done. If we do that, we can get your energy cost down 50%, 60%. So it means a lot to everybody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","14:27"
"Donald Trump","Sleepy Joe. Are you turning the cameras around? Could I ask you to turn, because you have never seen. People don’t even believe it. Look at them. Look at them. People don’t even believe it. I only get disappointed because honestly, the media, the fake news, is too close to me. If they were further back, we’d get more people up here, my people. I’m saying this to my representatives. If they move that back, they have magnifying lenses that are very good. If you move them back, you can have people. They wouldn’t be blocked out by the fake news.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","14:57"
"Donald Trump","Our lives are blocked out by the fake news, right? But Sleepy Joe voted for NAFTA, which was the worst thing that ever happened to your state and all of new England more than any place. Your factories are still, some of them, empty. And China’s entry into the world trade organization. He shuttered your factories, shipped away your industries, and he allowed deadly drugs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","15:37"
"Donald Trump","One thing I learned more than any other place, New Hampshire drugs. For some reason, you get hit harder than anybody else. We brought it down 19%. We took it down. Now, we got set back because when the plague came in, all of a sudden we’re looking at different things, but we got it down 19%. I met with your police. We went to the precincts. For some reason, your drug problem, opioids, everything else, is greater than most other states proportionately.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","16:01"
"Donald Trump","And we focused very hard in New Hampshire. We got it down 19%. It’s coming down further. Had a setback when the plague came in from China, but we got it down to 19 and we’re going to get it down a hell of a lot lower than 19 before we’re finished, believe me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","16:29"
"Donald Trump","And he allowed drugs, deadly drugs, really deadly drugs, opioids, and fentanyl to pour across our borders and flood into to your schools and your towns and communities, and more in New Hampshire proportionately, as I said, than any other place. In 2016, you voted to fire the depraved political establishment and you elected an outsider as your president who is finally putting America first. This is not the crowd that comes in second, okay? When you leave, it’s like a poll, right, except much more accurate, when you leave a place like this, where you have thousands and thousands of people and more people than all of this outside, unfortunately. Can’t get in, which I feel badly about. We put speakers out there, but they can’t get in.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","16:48"
"Donald Trump","But when you leave, you say, “This is not a state where you’re going to come in second.” It’s just not because come in second. If Joe came in, even if he came in in that beautiful Air Force One, is that beautiful? I’ll tell you a quick. We have plenty of time today, right? Is there any football game? We don’t watch football as much anymore, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","17:54"
"Donald Trump","Until they stand and honor our country, we don’t do it. Until they honor that. But, when I first came in, I said, “How old is Air Force One?” Now we have the greatest people in the world in our military. They’re incredible. Look at the condition. That plane looks like it’s two days old, right? But it’s 30 years. Can you believe it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","18:20"
"Donald Trump","So I said, “So what’s going on?” “Well, they’re negotiating with one and they signed a contract for $5.7 billion.” It’s actually two planes. People don’t realize this. Air Force One is two planes, okay? You always have two. You’re very spoiled when you have this job. I guess they figure if it’s ever a little bit off for a little broken, you just rip out the second one for two and a half billion.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","18:44"
"Donald Trump","But it’s a most incredible machine. So anyway, so I said, “Well, but 30 years is a long time.” I’m not talking about for me. I’m talking it’s long time. And I’m good at airplanes, okay? Been very good at airplanes. I said, “So what’s the price?” “5.7 billion.” I said, “You got to be kidding.” For two airplanes, okay? I have friends they order a gulf stream and they pay $ 78 million. I said, “Half of an engine costs more than that.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","19:08"
"Donald Trump","So 5.7. So I met with the head of Boeing, good man, and I said, “This is the first week.” I said, “We’re not going to buy it.” Signed contract, all done. 5.7 billion. I said, “Too much money. We’re not buying it.” They said, “Why do you say it’s too much?” I said, “Because Obama agreed to it, so it has to be too much.” It’s the only thing I knew. I didn’t know anything about it. I didn’t know anything about it, but I knew if they were buying it, it was too much money.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","19:35"
"Donald Trump","So I said, “Nope, I’m not going to do it.” I said, “Cancel the order.” So I went to a general, I said, “General, I want to cancel the order.” “Yes sir.” And I said, “Why can’t we keep using this 30 years, sir?” And he’s right. Look, planes would come in from especially other countries, but from Arab countries, and it would be a brand new, what’s called a 747 800. That’s brand new right off the thing. It’s actually a much different plane. It’s much longer. It’s got a much bigger wingspan. You wouldn’t believe it. See the top the way it is? It’s a much longer top.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","20:02"
"Donald Trump","I hope you people are interested in this. No, isn’t this better than being on a teleprompter, right? No, but see the front? It’s second floor is much longer. As beautiful as that is, it’s far more beautiful, bigger, more impressive, more everything, and it’s the right thing. So I said, “So general, it’s a signed contract. I want to terminate the contract.” “Yes sir.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","20:40"
"Donald Trump","I said, “By the way, you can terminate it no problem, right?” “Yes, sir. Very proud of it, sir.” “Good. You don’t have to pay anything, do you?” “Yes, sir. We have a termination fee.” “Oh. How much is the termination fee, general?” “Sir? We pay $250 million then we’re allowed to terminate the contract. It’s 5.7 billion. So for 250 million … ”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","21:09"
"Donald Trump","I said, “Wait a minute, general, wait. Wait, wait. They haven’t built it yet. They haven’t even started it yet. We have to pay $250 million to terminate the contract? I don’t like that deal, general. General, don’t terminate it, because I want to get it. But I don’t want to pay 250. Just don’t terminate it. Just tell them we don’t want it.” “Yes, sir.” So he told them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","21:32"
"Donald Trump","Then I told them, I said, “Nope, I don’t want it.” And we negotiated for about a month. And I said to the head of Boeing, really good guy, I said, ” Hey Dennis, look, it’s five, seven. It’s got to have a three in front of it.” Now I don’t know anything about it. And it’s very, very special. What they have in this plane they don’t have in any plane in the world, okay? This is incredible, the kind of equipment. The equipment costs more than the plane.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","21:52"
"Donald Trump","So I said, “No, Dennis. It has to have a three in front of it. So this has 5.7, a five.” I said, “Got to have it. In other words, we got to skip the fours. We got to have a three.” “No sir. I can’t do it.” So then he comes back a couple of weeks later. He takes a hundred million off. I said, “Nope, it’s got to have a three.” I said, “Cancel it. I don’t care.” “Don’t cancel it in writing.” I said, “We don’t want the planes.” I was very careful. “We don’t want the planes.” “Are you canceling the order?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","22:15"
"Donald Trump","I said, “No, no, no. We don’t want the plane,” because I don’t want to pay 250 of your money, if you don’t mind. And by the way, I could tell you about 300 of these stories, all right? These are stories that are all different things. This one, I just see the plane sitting there so beautiful. So I said, “No, we don’t want the plane.” Now I can’t really go to Europe and order the comparable plane because there is no comparable plane, but I can’t. I can’t say, “I’m going to buy it in Europe. I’m going to buy Air Force One in Europe.” Somehow that doesn’t work, so I can’t. I said, “No, we’re going to get used to this. We’re going to have this plane. We’ll fix it up. It’ll be just fine.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","22:43"
"Donald Trump","So time goes by and they raise it. They bring it down another couple of hundred. They bring it down another couple. And then all of a sudden it started dropping like a rock. And we agreed to 3.95. Somebody said, “Well, that must be a totally different plane.” Nope. In fact, I actually had one generator added.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","23:17"
"Donald Trump","It’s not a big deal, one generator added. Then Boeing came to me. So is 3.9, as opposed to 5.7. Now that took about two months, three months. But isn’t it really nice, right? The same exact plane, except with a different paint job.

"Donald Trump","… except with a different paint job. Our plane is going to be as beautiful as that looks, Jackie O. Our plane is going to be red, white, and blue. Doesn’t that make sense? Red white. And then they came to me and the general came to me. The general came to me and he said, “Sir, I know the way you like everything to be perfect. And sir, instead of coming down, see the big stairway on the left, you’re really up there. When you’re at that stairway, you’re on a three story building, right. And sir, if it’s rainy or bad weather or it’s blowing,” and I’m thinking about my hair, right. Oh, sometimes by the time I get down the big one, the little one is a different deal, but the big one, which we use 95%, by the time I come down that big stairway, sometimes I am wiped out. The wind is blowing. I said, “Is there any wind outside?” Yes sir. 50 miles an hour. That’s good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","24:03"
"Donald Trump","The stairs are shaking. I’m shaking. The whole thing. By the time I get into the car, I end up running the last… By the time I get into that car, I’m wiped out. Okay, I got to say, “Does anybody have a mirror?” So the general said, “Sir, we can build a new stairway under the plane, sir. It’s a spiral stairway.” I said, “Wow, that’s a great idea.” You’d be totally protected, sir. I said, “Fantastic. How much?” 50. I said, “Wow, 50. That’s a great deal. I’ll take it.” I said, “I’ll take it.” I said, “By the way, so for $50,000, I can build.” No, sir, $50 million. I said, “I don’t want this stairway for $50 million.” I tell you this because you people understand business. No, he said, “We can build it for 50.” I thought he meant $50,000. That’s a lot of money for a stairway. No, we can do it for 50 million.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","24:56"
"Donald Trump","So if you don’t mind, I decided let my hair get messed up, right. So that’s the story. That’s a long story on the beautiful Air Force One. So we have it coming in and can you imagine after all that I better win this damn contest. Can you imagine if I saw Sleepy, Joe? He wouldn’t even know it’s a different plane. He’d get on. Oh this is very nice. Where am I? Where am I? You’re on Air Force One. Oh, I didn’t know that. This is very nice. How old is this plane, he’d say? I’d say, “Brand new, sir. It’s brand new. Just…” If I see that gorgeous, you have to see the striping. It’s incredible. There’ll be nothing like it. And I don’t want to see it. He won’t appreciate it. He won’t appreciate it because he won’t understand it. But anyway, so that’s the story that I tell. I could tell a hundred stories like that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","25:53"
"Donald Trump","It’s all the same. The waste, it’s all the same. And it was all coming together and then we had to spend $3 trillion on the plague. Can you believe it? With all of that peanuts we’re talking, we had to spend and we signed a trade deal with China, which was so great, but the ink wasn’t dry when we got hit by the China plague and we’ll never forget it. We’ll never forget it. You watch. Sleepy Joe Biden doesn’t care about New Hampshire. I saw that. He left this state before the primary was even over. He abandoned you. He likes to say Pennsylvania. Well, he left them too when he was nine years old. And based on the polls, I’m seeing the people of Pennsylvania understand that very much. And as I said at the very beginning, a lot of strange things. We’re way up in Florida.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","26:51"
"Donald Trump","We’re doing fantastic in Iowa, fantastic in North Carolina. We think really good in Pennsylvania. We’re doing great in the great state of Texas and these aren’t poles. These are people now. Now you don’t need polls so much. These are people. We’re doing great all over. Georgia is looking very good. We’re doing great all over. This could be a very interesting evening on November 3rd. Now the biggest risk we have are the fake ballots. To me, they send millions of ballots all over the country. They found some in a garbage can, military ballots. The name Trump was written in by the military and they found them in a garbage can, thousands and thousands, 500,000 incorrect applications in Virginia, thousands and thousands of things.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","27:44"
"Donald Trump","I say the biggest risk we have are the fake ballots. I voted yesterday in Florida and I went and I voted in person because I like to vote in person, call me old fashioned, but a lot of our people want to vote in person. They want to vote. So I went to Florida. Sir, do you have identification? They said that. And no, and they didn’t mean to be rude. They want to go through like they would. I took out a passport. I gave them a passport. I took out an ID. Wouldn’t it be nice to have voter ID by the way?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","28:34"
"Donald Trump","So the woman who was great, very smart. And I gave her the passport. I gave her the ID. She said, “Sir, I think you might be President Trump.” Okay, so I qualify. And then I sat and they gave me the voting thing slips, very computerized, very good. I went through everyone. They said, “Sir, is this it?” Yes. Good. And then I signed my name on something else. Sir, you can go to the booth and please, here’s a pad. You can keep it secret. I said, “I don’t want to keep it secret. I voted for Donald Trump.” I don’t want to keep it secret. Now if I voted for Sleepy Joe, that would be a story, right. That I would want to keep secret. [inaudible 00:05:55].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","29:12"
"Donald Trump","No, but I went in, the people were fantastic. And I went in, really professional people, great people. I went in, I took it. I took it out of the folder. I mean, they wanted me to put it in a folder just to walk it 20 feet to a machine. I took it out. I put it in that. I put it in again, two pages, certain things they had and a lot of different races, the presidency and other races, good races, congressperson, good races. Put them in. And I said, “Wow, there was no cheating. There was no way you could cheat. There was no way anything could go wrong. It was like a perfect deal.” Now, they send. Think of that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","29:55"
"Donald Trump","So that’s one way. The other way they send millions of ballots. We don’t know who’s sending them. We don’t know where they’re going. We don’t know who’s bringing them back. We don’t know who signed them. In Nevada, they want to have a thing where you don’t have to have any verification of the signature. It is so terrible. And you know who knows it more than us? The Democrats, all Democrat run states are the ones that are the problem and they know it. And they say, “He’s against our freedom. He’s against our freedom.” No, no. I want to have a real election. I don’t want to have millions of votes sent to millions of different people. And I call them unsolicited. I say, “Solicited is good.” That’s where you write in. You want, they send it to you, et cetera, which still is not as good as being there, but it’s pretty good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","30:37"
"Donald Trump","But when you have unsolicited, meaning you don’t want them, they call them universal. I said, “That name doesn’t make sense.” What does it mean? It doesn’t mean anything. They call it different names. I came up with a name. They have millions of unsolicited ballots being sent all over and it’s no good. It’s no good. And there’s tremendous. Every day you pick up the newspaper and you read about the only good thing is we have people watching them like crazy, both law enforcement and yourselves and everybody, but in Philadelphia, which is notorious for what goes on, we want to have poll watchers. They won’t let us have poll watchers. So we’re in court over poll watchers. Why won’t they let you have a poll watcher? What’s wrong? Think of it. What’s wrong? Philadelphia has been unbelievable. When a candidate, very wonderful candidate happened to lose very badly, Ren, a number of years ago and a man named Mitt Romney. Did anybody ever hear of Mitt Romney? He did so badly in Philadelphia. Almost nobody voted for him. Now you know that’s not so, but they gave almost no votes for him, almost nothing. And you know that’s not so and it’s not right. And we want poll watchers in Philadelphia and they won’t let us have them so we’re in court. But think of it, when they won’t let you have a poll watcher, what’s that all about? What’s that all about? So we’re watching it very closely, but I was really impressed yesterday in Florida because there was no way there could be any cheating. There was no way. These people were great. The system is great and there was no way you’re voting twice, you’re voting 20 times or you’re not voting at all. It was a beautiful thing to see, but the ballots are not that way.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","31:28"
"Donald Trump","The ballots get handled by many, many people by the time they even get there and it shouldn’t be allowed. And the Democrats know it’s a hoax and they know and it’s going to cause problems. Then we have a ruling from a court. I won’t say which court, a ruling that the ballots can go beyond November 3rd and then they can take time too, in the state of Pennsylvania, which we love, which we think we’re going to win. I love Pennsylvania. I won it the last time against crooked Hillary, right. It was the first time in a long time that somebody won. And we have a situation where they have their ballots and they have a long time to count the ballots. A lot of bad things will happen during that period of time. Terrible things will happen, crooked, dishonest things. But that means that Pennsylvania, a major state, an important state, very important to me, I’m there all the time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","33:13"
"Donald Trump","I went to school there, Pennsylvania. So if we don’t know the result on November 3rd, that means unlike has always been where you generally find out the election that night or soon, we could be going on forever with this. It’s the craziest thing. And it’s frankly, it’s a crazy ruling and we shouldn’t let it happen. We shouldn’t let it happen. I think that’s my biggest fear. My biggest risk for this election is the unsolicited, the millions of unsolicited ballots they’re sending out. In California, they’re sending millions and millions and millions of ballots. People are getting ballots that don’t want them. People are getting ballots that don’t even know why they’re getting them. It’s a terrible thing. Sleepy Joe Biden works for big tech and big donors.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","34:11"
"Donald Trump","And I’ll tell you, when you watch what’s happened, how he’s being protected because you see what’s going on. He is a corrupt politician. And one of the reasons, and I would say the primary reason he’s put the lid on again is because he can’t answer the questions. No, he can’t answer these questions. He goes to China, the family makes a fortune. He goes to Ukraine, his son gets put on a board for $183,000 a month. How about Russia? Russia, the wife of the mayor of Moscow pays him three and a half million dollars for the son and then he has stuff that he has to give his father 10%. Then he has another one where it’s 50%. What the hell is going on? Terrible. And then the media refuses to write it. They refuse except for the New York Post by the way, who’s stock has gone way up. I have a lot of respect for the New York Post. What they’ve done is incredible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","35:06"
"Donald Trump","So I’m not just running against Joe Biden, I’m running against the left wing media and Silicon Valley, censors who want to manipulate and control the American people. No, it’s unbelievable. And if you say anything bad about Biden, they block you, they take you down or they make it so you can’t go on any of these sites, Twitter or any of them. It’s unbelievable. Some high quality people. They put up a story from the New York Post, fourth largest newspaper in the country and the oldest by far founded by Alexander Hamilton, somebody puts up a story about this Biden corruption, which is incredible, and they block the story and take down his site. It’s unbelievable. The great Charlie Kirk, Charlie Kirk, but many of them. With your vote, we will continue to fight for American workers, lower drug prices. We are bringing drug prices down, way down. It’s already happened.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","36:08"
"Donald Trump","Support our great police, protect the 2nd Amendment, defend our borders that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that very beautiful phrase made in the USA like the old days, right. We go back to the old days sometimes. Made in the USA, people used to be so proud of that. We are again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","37:07"

"Donald Trump","We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, groundbreaking therapies, the therapies are unbelievable. By the way, here I am. Now, I don’t know, maybe I didn’t need it. Maybe I didn’t need it, but I’m happy. I took that Regeneron. Regeneron, Superman, and a safe vaccine. And we have many of our greatest companies and labs are coming out very quickly with the vaccines. They’re doing great. Very shortly, very quickly. It’s going to be delivered fast. That will quickly end the pandemic. It’s ending anyway. We’re rounding the turn, but the vaccine will get it down fast because we want normal life to resume, normal life. We just want normal. Normal life, normal life. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. Last year, New Hampshire had by far the best year economically that you’ve ever had. And I can say that for I think every state in the Union. I really think just about, I don’t have to go check.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","37:38"
"Donald Trump","I don’t have to be like Joe, where he has no idea. You just say no, it’s uniform. I think just about every state in the Union and you see what’s happening now. We have a super V. We’re recovering at a level, housing starts. The Atlanta Fed just predicted, now this is not a forecast by me, this is the Atlanta Fed, that GDP will rise for the third quarter, which will end by the way. I think the number will be produced on November 1st, which is just before, but hopefully you’ll have voted by that time. That’s the crazy thing. Everybody will have voted before some of this incredible news comes in, but the news has been very good anyway. They’re predicting GDP up 35%. Nobody’s ever had that, right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","38:41"
"Donald Trump","I think 8%. I don’t know what the record is, but like eight or nine or something maybe as a record, but this is 35% up, faster than any other country anywhere in the world. We went down less and we’ve gone up faster. So within my first year in office, I delivered the largest tax cuts and reform in the history of our country. We cut taxes $2,200 a year so that’s for the typical American family. We doubled the child tax credit $1,000 a child, and we increased median household income to the highest levels ever recorded. Highest. Then we had to close it up, save millions of lives, at least 2 million lives, and now we’re opening it up. The radical Biden Harris agenda. What do you think of Harris? Oh boy. More liberal than Crazy Bernie, could you believe it? So you have Crazy Bernie. He’s crazy, there’s no question, but he’s a good sport. He’s a great sport. No, no. Have you ever seen anybody lose so much and be so happy about it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","39:33"
"Donald Trump","It’s happened now twice. Is Bernie running again in four years? Media, is Bernie Sanders projected to run again in four years? I think so. He’ll be up there. One thing about him, he fights. He fights, but he somehow doesn’t mind losing because Elizabeth Warren, a neighbor of yours. No, Elizabeth Warren super radical left, not as bad as Bernie, and by the way, not even close to Kamala, but if she would have, and I say all the time, if she would have left because she was gone. She was gone. If she would have left before Super Tuesday, Bernie would have won every single state that Sleepy Joe. He was shocked when he won. They said, “Joe, you won.” What? What? I did? How? What happened?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","40:49"
"Donald Trump","Well, Elizabeth Warren stayed in the race, Joe. So when people voted, they voted, they split the vote. So Bernie Sanders would’ve gotten all of it. He didn’t have to get all. If he got just a few of her votes, he would’ve won everything. I mean, literally, but he would’ve gotten almost all of them. He said, “Oh, okay. Explain? How does that work?” They said, ” Forget it Joe.” He wanted to know how that worked. The radical Biden Harris agenda is projected to slash the typical American’s income. And you saw this in the Wall Street Journal, income by $6,500 a year over a short period of time. And also, it will destroy at least 5 million jobs. Joe Biden is promising the largest tax hike in American history. This is the first time, I said it last night, we were in Ohio. We were in Wisconsin, we were in North Carolina. I’m doing three or four of these suckers a day. That’s not bad, right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","41:41"
"Donald Trump","And he’s got the lid on every… I said, “Where is he campaigning?” Sir, he’s decided. You can’t have a president in this world where you have President Xi, President Putin, Kim Jong-Un, and lots of people. You cannot have a low energy president. Now, there’s a reason he’s got the lid and I’m trying to figure it out. And I have a feeling it’s because of the corruption because he can’t have. Did you see where he walked out in primetime right after it happened holding ice cream, right? And the press asked him, “What flavor is it, sir? What flavor?” Uh, I think it’s vanilla and chocolate. That was the question. They don’t ask me questions like that. What flavor, sir? I don’t think he likes me too much. We better win. No, he’s not a nice guy. He’s not. No, people that knew him in primetime.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","42:43"
"Donald Trump","People that knew him in primetime. He was never a nice guy, phony guy. He was never a nice guy. I don’t think he’s a nice guy, but now he’s probably more agitated than ever before. Biden’s $4 trillion tax increase is a missile aimed at the heart of the middle-class and middle-class families. That’s all it is. You’re going to lose all your jobs. These companies are all going to go back where they came from. We brought in tremendous numbers of companies. I mean, look at the auto business. We hadn’t had a factory in 40 years and now they’re opening up all over Michigan, all over the place. Ohio, North Carolina, South Carolina. I’d say to the Prime Minister Abe, a great, great gentleman who retired. He had a problem, medical problem, but he retired. I’d say, “Shinzo, you got to open some factories in Michigan. You got to open up some factories in the US. I don’t care where, you’re going to open up factories, Shinzo. You’re selling too many cars made in Japan. You got to make them in the US.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","43:48"
"Donald Trump","Then he’d say, “Well, I don’t do that. I mean, look, we don’t have anything to do with that. This is done by the private sector.” I said, “Shinzo, you’re a powerful man. You can do it.” I really can’t. I said, “You have to do it.” Next day, they announced five companies were opening up factories so that was the end of that. And he’s a great guy, Shinzo, and I hope he’s going to be well. He was a great leader of Japan. In my second term, I will pass another historic middle class tax cut. It’s already… Biden, all my life I’ve been studying politics. I watched it. I was on the other side. I was a contributor to like everybody. They came to my office. I was a contributor to everybody. And they would come in, but all my life I watched and I’d watch Texas. And I’ve never seen this before where somebody goes, “We will raise your taxes. Vote for me.” No, it’s never happened. I’ve always watched politicians. We will cut your taxes. We will cut your taxes. We will cut your taxes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","44:51"
"Donald Trump","Biden gets up, “We will raise your taxes.” And people say, ” Oh.” A lot of people don’t get it. They’ll go like, “Oh, did I hear that right?” No, he’s going to raise your taxes. So Biden wants to eliminate oil. Think of it in Texas. You saw him in the debate the other night. Now, he can’t get away with that. I said, “So tell me, because he almost made it.” And then that last question got him. And Kristin, who is not particularly in my camp, I thought she did a good job to be honest. I thought she did a good job. She looks at him. She goes, “Why would you do that?” And then I said, “Yeah, why would you do that?” And unfortunately for his party, he said he will transition out of oil. And I said, “Are you listening, Texas, right? Are you listening Pennsylvania? And are all the people in the country because we have an energy independent country right now.” And once we get New Hampshire and New England, the pipeline cutting across New York, which we’re very close to getting, you will have energy prices that will be low, very low. Very low. And nobody else will be able to get that pipeline, that I can tell you, nobody else. That means that no heat in New Hampshire winters. $5 a gallon gasoline, much more than that I think. Think of it, what are you now? $2. And you’ll go under $2, right, $2, right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","45:54"

Can you believe it? The Middle East, we’re doing peace. I did it the opposite way of what these fools did for years. We just signed the third Sudan yesterday. We signed.

"Donald Trump","Led by a great gentleman, a great leader, a great warrior, actually, Muhammad. And yesterday we got Sudan. I mean, no blood in the sand, no cost, no this, no that. The opposite way. And then we got one, Serbia. We had Serbia, because this relates to Armenia. We had Serbia, Kosovo. We’re doing a trade deal. I said, “Wait a minute. These people, right, Serbia, these people have been killing themselves. They’ve been killing each other for years and years and decades. And we’re dealing with both of them unrelated.” I said, “Fellas, if you don’t get your act together, we’re not going to deal with you. What the hell do we have to deal for? We don’t have to. We’re doing trade deals.” I said, “Wait a minute.” They’ve been fighting each other and killing each other for years. I told my people, “Tell them they got to work a deal. Otherwise, we’re not going to do a deal with either of them.” Cost us nothing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","48:03"
"Donald Trump","And you know what? They hugged and they kissed in the Oval Office and they were so happy. And this is after many years. Nobody thought they could come together. Nobody thought they’d come together. That deal was worse than Israel, if you think about it, and the Palestinians. Israel and the Palestinians, they say can’t, it’ll come together. It’ll come together. We stopped paying. We used to give the Palestinians $750 million a year. And I said, “Look, we’re not going to pay you if you’re not going to make a deal. Why would we pay?” And other people said that was a terrible thing. It wasn’t a terrible thing because they’d say death to America, death to Israel, et cetera, et cetera. And now they want to talk. They all want to talk. So we have three countries. We have many countries lined up. You’ll end up with peace in the Middle East with nothing but for nothing. And a neighbor of yours, John Kerry, said two years ago, “It would be impossible to do the deal that way.” No, no. That’s the only way you can do the deal. It’s all coming together beautifully. We’re going to have peace in the Middle East. What we’ve done is pretty amazing. But with Serbia, Kosovo, so we signed a deal. So they gave me a Nobel Prize for that. They gave me a Nobel Prize for something else. They should give me a Nobel Prize for what I did in Syria. When I say Nobel Prize, nomination, I don’t know. I don’t know.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","48:47"
"Donald Trump","But with Serbia. So now we have Armenia. Look at the Armenia. They are incredible people. They’re fighting like hell, right? They’re fighting like hell. And you know what? We’re going to get something done because, thank you. And I love you, too. You know the Armenians have had a tough go. In fact, I was in yesterday, Ohio, actually. I was in Ohio because I went to various stops. But in Ohio we had a tremendous group of Armenians with the flag and the whole thing, the spirit. And the problems that they have and the death and the fighting and everything else, we’ll get that straightened out. I call that an easy one. Okay? We’ll get that. Go back and tell your people. Go back and tell your people. All right? We’ll get that straightened out. Armenia. Why not? It’s easy. If you know what you’re doing, it’s like that. If you know what you’re doing, it’s easy. But we will.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","50:14"
"Donald Trump","But think of that, with Kosovo, Serbia I said, “Well, we’re doing these two. We’re not doing either deal unless they put it together.” And they actually, they both came back. The prime ministers, they came back, they were in the Oval Office two weeks ago, hugging and kissing. It was an incredible thing, very historic. And what are we doing? We’re saving a lot of lives. We’re saving a lot of good people from being killed. See, normally I wouldn’t tell you all this stuff, but we’re in the afternoon. Where are we going from here? There’s no more NFL that you watch. Where the hell are we going?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","51:17"
"Donald Trump","Biden has also vowed. Do you think sleepy Joe would be doing these things? I don’t think so. I don’t think. He’ll go back to bed. Hillary used to spend a lot of time in bed too, but she had more energy than him. She did. They said, “What’s the difference between crooked Hillary Clinton and Biden?” I said, “Well, obviously they’re both crooked, but let’s get out of that.” The big difference is she had more energy, but not much. And she’s a more intelligent person. I will say that. She’s a much more intelligent person. Until she used the word deplorables, I thought she was very smart. Biden has also vowed to impose the highest business tax rate in the developed world on companies that created jobs in our country. They came over here. They created jobs. They’ll be gone in two minutes. It would trigger a mass exodus of companies and jobs out of America and back into the places they came for or other places. That’s what happens. They would leave.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","51:53"
"Donald Trump","And we don’t want people to leave. We want them to stay. And we want those jobs and we want that income. You’ve had them leave already under NAFTA. Biden also pledged to eliminate our tariffs on China. We’re taking in tens of billions of dollars. We taxed them where they dumped the steel. We taxed them where they targeted our farmers. I gave our farmers, this doesn’t pertain too much to you, but a little bit. I gave our farmers $28 billion from China because they were targeted and it kept our farmers solvent and actually strong. In other words, he wants to raise taxes on American factories and give preferential treatment to Chinese factories. There’s nobody that wants to see us raise taxes on companies more than China and other countries, because they’re going to pick up the business.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","52:55"
"Donald Trump","So remember this. If Biden wins, China wins. If we win, New Hampshire wins and America wins. It’s very simple. It’s very simple. Besides that, how could he make a deal with China when he’s taking a lot of money out of China, right? For himself and his family. His son walked away with a billion and a half dollars. He gets fees on a billion and a half. So how can a guy like that, seriously? Did you see the letter? Oh, that laptop he’s got. You know the laptop? You know what it’s called? I said it last night in Wisconsin. It’s called the laptop from hell. Right? That laptop. That laptop is not good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","53:46"
"Donald Trump","But did you see that he wants $10 million a year from China for introductory reasons? In other words, he’s going to introduce him to people. You know who the people are going to be? His father. Going to introduce him to his father. So this guy was, we won’t say why and how, sadly no longer in the Navy. Right? Empty years, nothing. And then his father becomes Vice President and now he’s making tens of millions of dollars. It’s wrong. It’s wrong. And Joe’s making it too, by the way. Joe’s making it, too. 10%. We got to give 10% to the big guy. Oh, what does that mean? Tell us. What is 10% to the big guy mean? Explain that. That’s why Joe has the lid on. The Biden tax hikes will also reimpose Obamacare’s individual mandate penalty, which I ended. I ended the individual mandate, most unpopular part, which really makes it not even Obamacare anymore. We took the most egregious thing, and Obamacare was the individual mandate. You had to pay a fortune for the privileges of not paying a fortune to have terrible health insurance. All right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","54:29"
"Donald Trump","And in the meantime, we’ve brought the rates down. We’ve done it well, we’ve done a great job with it, but much better would be if we come up with brand new healthcare. We’ll see what happens in the Supreme Court. Always protecting people with pre-existing conditions. Always. 80% of this tax would fall on Americans making less than 50,000 a year. He keeps talking about the 400. It doesn’t work that way. And he knows that. Well, he doesn’t know it, but the people surrounding him. There’s virtually no aspect of American life that Joe Biden does not want to tax and regulate into oblivion. And worse will be the regulations because the taxes will go through the roof. But I think that the biggest reason we were successful is that I took off more regulations than any president, whether it’s four years, eight years, or in one case, more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","55:48"
"Donald Trump","He’s always wanted to do this, massively cut your social security and your Medicare. And it’s all part of the war on the middle-class. I don’t know. I don’t know what he’s thinking. I’ve never seen a politician that wants to hurt social security that survives, and then he denied it. But you’ll see in a second, because you don’t have to take my word for it. Just listen to Biden explain his crazy views and crazy plans just a little while ago. So roll out the video. I do this because I love this state. I spent a fortune for that. So I hope it works.

First African-American state Senator in the State of Delaware. And by the way, I sit on the stand and I get hot, I got a hairy legs that turn blonde in the sun. And the kids used to come up and reach into the bowl and rub my leg down so it was straight and then watch the hair come back up again. They’d look at it. So I learned about roaches.

He will not let you frack. It’s not him. His party will never let you frack. Okay? It’s a million jobs in Pennsylvania.

If he gets in, you’re going to have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen before with the possible exception of 1929. He’s going to raise your taxes through the sky. He’s going to put all those regulations. It would take 18 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to two. We’re trying to get it down to one and it may not get approved for environmental or for safety reasons, but you’re going to know very quickly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:01:40"
"Donald Trump","We have regulation cuts. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. He wants to put all that garbage back in. All that wasted, wasted stuff. And we have more cuts to come and we need regulation. We’re going to have regulation, but it’s going to be reasonable. It’s not going to be where it’s impossible to build a simple road from point A to point B. So you have a choice, New Hampshire, between a Trump boom or a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock it down. He said, “No, I’d lock it down.” We’re not locking down. We understand the disease. We’re going to take such, and we’ve been, taking care of our elderly, especially with heart or diabetes problems. And we’re going to take care of it. And we’re going to be careful, and we’re going to be vigilant, but we’re not locking down. He would lock it down in a heartbeat. He would.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:02:27"
"Donald Trump","The Biden lockdown would permanently destroy the lives and dreams of tens of millions of our citizens. Wipe out what will be, and what’s turning out to be, the greatest economic comeback of all time. You see what’s happening. Desperately hurt our small businesses, inflict lasting harm on our children and massively reduce life expectancy for the American people, life expectancy. So, for the American people, you see what happens. And I came up with a statement. I don’t know, I think it was me. They’ll try and find somebody else said it 25 years ago, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself.

No, but look, and we won that case in the Supreme Court. Michigan has to open. It was unconstitutional. She was running like jail cells over there and Pennsylvania, right? And so many other places. But fortunately you people are in good shape. You’re in good shape. You have no complaints. Lockdowns will also lead to a surge in drug overdoses. That’s what’s happening. Drugs, alcohol, depression, suicides all over the place. Tremendous family disputes like they’ve never had before. It’s a horrible thing that happens. The cure can’t be worse.

I learned so much about that whole drug problem from New Hampshire. This is really the place. And you have incredible law enforcement police, fire departments, where I met with them. And they know this problem better than the experts. Biden is the shutdown candidate. The Democrats are the shutdown party. They will shut down your job, shut down your schools, your businesses, your police departments, your energy. They’ll shut down your freedom.

We left them in the dust. Now all of a sudden we have to shut it down. But we saved, remember, 2.2 million people were going to die. We saved 2 million people and now we’re opening up and it was a great honor. We had such incredible people. Ventilators, what we did with ventilators. We didn’t have ventilators and now we’re making them for the entire world. We have all we can use in our country. We got along great with a lot of the governors. Some governors, they were all thankful of the phone. “Sir, this is incredible what you’ve done for this state, that state.” If they happen to be not good people, they would then go out and see the reporters.

If this were another administration, you wouldn’t have vaccines for three years. If this were another administration, you wouldn’t have Regeneron that nobody heard of four months ago. You wouldn’t have these new super drugs. And you look at the mortality rate down 85%. 85. That’s incredible. And then you look at Europe and what’s going on. They always used to use Europe. Now they’re not using it anymore. Yet as we’ve seen from surging cases in Europe, their never ending shutdowns. It just never stops. Europe shut it down tight, shut it down tight. And now they have a surge. And it’ll work out, but it should have never happened. Should have never happened from China. They closed up most of China, but they didn’t close the world. They let it come to Europe, the US, the rest of the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:06:50"

This election day, the people of New Hampshire must stop the anti-American radicals by giving Joe Biden, and it’s really not Joe Biden, it’s the people that control him, the people that surround him, because Joe doesn’t have a clue. Joe doesn’t have a clue. I really believe he doesn’t have a clue. We can be nice and we can say, “Oh, it’s okay,” or, “Let’s vote for him. We feel sorry.” There’s nothing to feel sorry about. This is our democracy. This is our country. We have to do what’s right. And he’s not a nice person. He’s not a nice person. We have to give the Democrats a thundering defeat.

Corky Messner. Where is Corky? Corky Messner is doing great. I hear he’s doing great, right? Is he? He better do great.

So I got it about one o’clock in the morning, just left. Actually four states. Left Florida, right, where I voted. I went to North Carolina, I went to Ohio. I did a big one in Ohio.

What’s this all about?” And then I said, “Well, not only didn’t we kill, I didn’t even know they weren’t going to open. I’m more focused on China, if you don’t mind.” And when I heard that, I said, “That’s terrible.” I called the commissioner of football, the commissioner of Big Ten, nice guy, Warren. I said, “Commissioner, we got to get it back.” And he was good. And we worked very hard. I had a great group of people, Tim Pataki and some others, and we got it back. And then we got PAC-12 back, too. I said, “Get it back, get it back. We got to get it back.” So we have Big Ten opened up. Ohio State won and Wisconsin won so they both won. It’s nice that they won.

Make America Great Again Again. No, we did. We had it. We had the greatest economy. And I’ll tell you something, we were coming together. You’ve heard me say this. I was getting calls from people that normally I wouldn’t be getting calls from. We had the best numbers, the best everything in every way, and things were happening. Success will bring us together and we’re going to soon have that same. We will soon be in that position again. Very soon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:13:15"
"Donald Trump","We increased family income over $6,000, more than five times the gains in all eight years. So think of that. In three and a half years, we did more than they did in eight years, times five. I mean, think of that. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached the lowest levels ever recorded. Women had unbelievable numbers and more women were working than ever at any time before. Think of it. Think of it. Think of that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:14:06"
"Donald Trump","And by the way, suburban women, you know that. I got rid of the regulation. You know, they keep saying, he’s not going to do well with suburban women. And you know why they say that? WhY Because I’m going to stop crime. You know, their next spot, the Antifa people, it only happens with the Democrat run areas, right? But like in Portland, but their next stop is suburbia. But I got rid of the regulation that will allow projects to be built right alongside of your home. And I think that I have a feeling suburban women are going to be voting for Trump. And you know, if Biden gets in, they’re putting that regulation, very specific, they’re putting that regulation back, and you’re going to have low-income housing and projects built. You’re going to have crime like you never saw. And you’re going to want to get the hell out of suburbia. So I think we’re going to do very well with suburban women. And I think it’s going to be one of the surprise.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:14:48"
"Donald Trump","Remember last time, four years ago, we listened. I suffered with this for six months. My wife would say, our First Lady, by the way says hello to everybody. She tested positive also. How about that? She was positive and then she was better within a few days, you know? But she, thank you, but she’s, she’s great. People love, they love Melania. Every time I go, they have signs, we love our First Lady. We love our First Lady. She’s great. Great First Lady. She represents you well, I can tell you. They don’t treat her fairly, but that’s all right. She understands it very well. She’s done a great job, very popular.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:15:50"

And then they said, wow, he did well with women. They’re crying. They crying. They said, “What happened? What happened?” He did well with women. Was that the greatest evening, really? Remember? Remember? I wasn’t going to win Florida. I wasn’t going to win North Carolina. I wasn’t going to win Pennsylvania. Michigan wasn’t even talked about. Nobody had won Michigan for decades and decades, republican.

"Donald Trump","All of a sudden they start, the evening begins, “Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio by eight points.” Nobody ever thought possible. That hasn’t happened. So I started off with Ohio and they all said, “Eight points. What’s going on?” That’s when we knew there was something happening. Eight points. Donald Trump won. Then we won Florida. We won Georgia. We won South Carolina. Then we won their firewall. They called it North Carolina. They spent a fortune. They spent a fortune in North Carolina. We won North Carolina and then we just ran it up.

He was like, “Well, this is not that bad that he lost Florida, that Hillary lost Florida. She could do.” But then when we started getting into Pennsylvania, North Carolina, they started getting a little bit worried. Right? No, that was an amazing evening.

"Donald Trump","After the virus hit, we recovered faster than any major nation in the world. We’re in the process now, but there’s no nation in the world that’s recovered like we’ve recovered. Since April, we created a record 11.4 million jobs. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden and Obama inflicted. Look. Look. We’ve done more in 47 months than sleepy Joe has done in 47 years, and I really mean it, too. I really do. Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt and treacherous political class that I’ve had to deal with. Nobody told me the swamp was going to be that vicious or that deep. Swamp creatures, I can’t even believe it. I thought it would be a lot easier. They’re tougher, smarter, more vicious, and we’re beating the hell out of them. We’re beating the hell out of them. And they got rich by bleeding America dry.

"Donald Trump","By the way, you know all the money he raises? I could raise much more. I could sit for one day in the White House and call up every guy on Wall Street, the heads of every firm. I need $10 million. I need $25 million right now. Give it to the campaign. I’d have money. I would set every record in the book. I don’t want to do that because when you do that, when you do that, number one, we don’t need it. You remember, last time we had, I mean, Hillary spent three or four times more money. It’s not about the money. In fact, recently I was criticized. They said, Hillary Clinton raised more money than Donald Trump. I said, “What the hell?” Because you know, we won, and they’re bragging that she raised more money. My father taught me a long time ago, if you can win and spend less money, that’s a good thing, not a bad thing. Right? That’s a good thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:19:36"
"Donald Trump","But I would have those donors. They would be talking, “Trump raised $900 million.” I could do that so easy, but I don’t want to do that. If I do that, you’ll see there’s something wrong. I’m the President of the United States. I know many of these people. Every time he raises big money like that, they’ve made deals. They’ve made deals. They’re very simple. I serve the people. Joe Biden is proven to be a corrupt politician, whether you like it or not. He’s a corrupt politician. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because I’m not a politician.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:20:28"
"Donald Trump","And People of New Hampshire, you had a lot to do with it because that was a very big win we had here in that primary. And you don’t want a politician.

"Donald Trump","I ended the NAFTA nightmare, and you know it better than anybody else. You have the scars of it better than almost any other place in the United States, and proudly signed the brand new USMCA, which has just kicked in, whole different ball game. I wouldn’t say Mexico and Canada are thrilled with that deal, but that’s okay. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history. And the wall is going to be finished very shortly, over 400 miles. We’re doing 10 miles a week. 10 miles a week. We’re doing 10 miles a week. Biden and Harris, the wall, you notice they don’t talk about the wall anymore. They used to say, “The wall will never get built.” Every day, front page hammering me, hammering me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:21:34"

You know, the RINOs in many ways, are worse than all of them. That’s Republican in name only. Does anybody know? No, I had this major group of guys and they used to hammer me. The wall will not happen. It will not happen. Then I won a couple of cases. They kept saying, then the wall started. Now they never mentioned the wall anymore.

"Donald Trump","Biden and Harris have put forward the most radical immigration plan ever conceived by a major party, including nationwide catch and release, which means open borders. It’s a disaster. Catch, you catch a murderer, you catch a rapist, you know they’re murderers, you know their rapists and you release them only into our country. If you don’t mind, I ended it. And it was very tough to end it. It was very tough. And then Joe said the other night, “And they come back to court.” No, no, no. They never come back. I told him only a very low IQ individual comes back. They never come back. He said, “They come back for a trial.” They say, “Come back in four years.” And then nobody comes back. Why would they come back? There’s no reason to come back. They would never come back. Only, I’m serious, like 1%, a tiny fraction comes back. And he so solid on that. Right? You saw that. “They then come back for a trial.” He was making it sound, catch and release was a disaster. I’ve ended it.

"Donald Trump","Our country would surrender control of our border, and we would surrender control to the cartels in Mexico who are vicious. The Biden border plan would be the biggest gift in the history. There’s never been anything like it to drug traffickers, to human traffickers. They traffick in women, not so much children, not men almost at all. They traffick in women. And because of the wall, they can’t come in. This is a problem, by the way, that’s all over the world. This is not just us and Southern border. This is a modern day problem at a level that it’s never been before. They traffick in women all over the world. And it’s because of the internet, because of the computer, but it’s because of the internet and children to a much lesser extent, but women. But the drug traffickers would be allowed to freely infiltrate our country and pump their poison into our towns and schools, especially places like New Hampshire, where it was so prevalent before I came onto the scene, and it’s been a lot better, and we’re going to get it much, much better.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-manchester-new-hampshire-rally-transcript-october-25","Donald Trump Manchester, New Hampshire Rally Transcript October 25","01:24:07"

We even have our Navy, our ships are now in the Gulf and in the Pacific getting it, because when we closed up the border, they went by water. Okay? They don’t miss a trick. They’re very smart, but we’re seizing tremendous amounts in the ocean and in the Gulf. Working with Colombian officials, we’ve also seized or disrupted 227 tons of poisonous narcotics since April. That’s just since April. And then Joe Biden goes out and says the other day that America is nothing more than an idea. No. America is a great country. That’s what it is. It’s not an idea.

It’s going to be far less likely to use when we have it. But it’s all been brought back.

And by the way, the first call I get if we win, will be from the leaders of Iran. They want to make a deal because their country is going to hell with the sanctions. They’re down 26 or 27% in GDP, which I think is a record also. I recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem.
