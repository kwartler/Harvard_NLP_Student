"Donald Trump","Well thank you very much, Ohio. Thank you very much. Thank you. You know, this is really not a rally, you know this, this has to do with workers, programs, all the things we love, but this is really, we call it a friendly protest. And you know what we’re protesting? We’re protesting stupidity. Because there’s so many stupid things you see here. But hello, I’ll tell you what Ohio, how good have you been? How good have you been? What did we win by? A lot. And your governor’s here, and he just said you’re winning by a lot more this time than last time. So that’s good. Thank you. Mike, thank you very much. But hello, Ohio. And thank you very much. I’m thrilled to be here in Dayton, the home of the Wright Brothers, wow. I wonder what they would think when they see some of these F-35s and these crazy planes that we make nowadays that go thousands of miles an hour, right? I wonder.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","07:55"
"Donald Trump","But I want to just thank the very hard working patriots who are the backbone of America. You really are. You’re the backbone of America. This is an amazing group of people. This is an amazing group. You know, I’m going to another very nice spot in Ohio where we do have a rally, but I can’t imagine you have many more people than we have here, but they will, about 10 times more. No, this is for us and our friends and workers. We want workers. 43 days from now, We are going to win this state. We are going to win four more years in the White House. That’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","08:58"
"Crowd","Four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years, four more years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","09:37"
"Donald Trump","Thank you. Thank you. You had your best year in the history of your state and the history of our country last year. And we had it until the plague came in, and now we’re building it up again rapidly, but you had the best year, and we’re going to have… next year will be the best year we’ve ever had. I believe that. You’ll see that in the third quarter. But we’re here today to talk about jobs. We’re talking about jobs, a very favorite subject of mine to know and to understand that the choice in November is going to be very simple. There’s never been a time where there’s such a difference. One is probably communism. I don’t know. They keep saying socialism. I think they’re gone. They’ve got over that one, that one’s passed already. Joe Biden spent the last 47 years shipping your jobs to China, and foreign countries. You know that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","09:48"

"Donald Trump","And I’ve spent the last four years bringing the jobs back to our country, and back to Ohio. On November 3rd, Americans will decide whether we lift our nation to soaring new heights of prosperity, or whether we will allow a Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, to shut down our economy, impose a four trillion, that’s with a T, by the way, $4 trillion tax hike, abolish Ohio clean coal, oil, natural gas, and ship your jobs and factories and dreams overseas to China and countries that you’ve never even heard of. Put simply, if Biden wins, China wins. If we win, Ohio wins, and most importantly, in all fairness, America wins. Because you finally have a president who puts America first. And I do put America first. I guess that’s why almost four years ago, that’s why I did this, right? It’s because of this, probably more than any other reason. I watched the jobs going out. I never saw anything so stupid in my life. I watched the worst trade deals, and we’ve reversed many of them, almost all of them now, but we’ve reversed them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","10:41"
"Donald Trump","And again, we were having the greatest year we’ve ever had, and it’s going to be back very soon. You take a look at what’s happening. We’re joined today by a real good friend of mine. Somebody that’s been with me from the beginning. And I’ve been with him from the beginning, Ohio Governor, Mike DeWine. Where’s Mike? Where’s Mike? He’s opening up. Where’s Mike? Thank you, Mike. Thank you, Mike. He’s a good man. And Lieutenant governor John Euston. Good guys. Yeah. Thanks John. Good job. Congressman Warren Davidson, do you know Warren? Wow. Warren, that’s very impressive. These are real warriors. I’ll tell you another one, Mike Turner. Do we know Mike? Hell of a lawyer. Thank you, Mike. Thanks for all the help too, both of you, really appreciate it. And a man, I don’t know if you know him. He should become legendary, because when we didn’t have a lot of support, I had a guy named Bob Paduchik, do you know Bob? He kept saying, every time I said, “You know, we’re not getting the kind of support from the top people.” He said, “That’s okay, sir, you went up another two points.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","12:03"
"Donald Trump","We won this state by a lot. Remember the fake news. It’s a lot of it back there too, a lot of fake news. But they were going around Mike, hey Mike, they were going around saying, “Well, Trump may not be able to, in order to when you have to win Ohio, right? And then for a year, I heard, “You cannot win unless you win the great state of Ohio.” But they didn’t say the great state, I say the great state. And I heard it. I heard it for so long. It would be impossible. And then we won that night by what? Nine points? What was it Bob? Nine points. We won by a lot. In fact, it was the first indication that that was going to be a tough night for the Democrats. They said, “Ladies and gentlemen, not only did Trump win Ohio, he won by a hell of a lot more than we anticipated.” And then we won, look at these guys. That’s why I love these guys. Look at this. Nobody’s messing with these guys. You know, they’re great workers, but we use them also for security. If everyone gets a little bit rough, you’ll take care, right fellas? Thank you very much. Thank you. But we won it big, and that was the beginning of one of the most exciting nights in history, because we did something in 2016 that was amazing. And I’ll tell you, honestly, there is more enthusiasm now, and this is fact. In fact, they have a new thing. First of all, you know, we’re working very hard on getting a third Supreme Court Justice. I’m going to announce who that is. The only thing I’ll say, for the women, it will be a woman. Uh oh. There are a lot of angry people. Okay. Here’s the question. Okay. It will be a woman. Does anybody here, please raise your hand if you have the courage, is there anybody here that insists that it will be and should be a man? Is there anybody with the courage, please put up your hand right now. A lot of women here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","13:28"
"Donald Trump","So, okay. Ready? Supreme Court Justice, most powerful, most important, just the most important, you know, when you become president, they say, “This is the single most important thing a president does, is pick Supreme Court… ” And by the way, by the end of the first term, we will have 300 federal judges, a record. So let’s give me a free poll. We do this, I have such fun with it. We do it. Give me a free poll. If they go out, they charge hundreds of thousands of dollars. They interview like 19 people, which mean nothing. Here we got a lot of people. So give me a free poll, who would like to see a woman Justice of the Supreme Court. Who would like to see a male Justice of the Supreme Court. The only one I hear there is women. Some women. What’s that all about? No, it will be a brilliant person. It will be, I have five that we’re vetting right now. It’ll be a brilliant person. It will be a woman. It will be a woman. And we’re looking forward to it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","15:44"
"Donald Trump","And it will probably announce it on Saturday, maybe Friday, but Saturday. And it’s a big day for our country. It’s a big day for you. It’s a big day for Ohio. And so I think it will be great. I always love, why’d you say that? Like big day for Ohio, and I do it somewhat routinely. Do you ever notice when Biden goes out, and he always picks the wrong location. Like if he’s in Ohio, it’s great to be in the state of Florida. And he looks around, and he doesn’t see too many palm trees. He says, “Are we in Florida?” “No, you’re not.” He did that seven times. How do you do that? When you do that, you just walk off the stage. It’s over. There’s nothing you can do. You can make the greatest remainder of the speech, there’s nothing you can do to save it. But the people of Dayton know better than anyone, the terrible damage that Biden has inflicted over his nearly 50 years, 47 years to be exact. Can you believe it? For 47 years, Joe Biden shook the hands of American workers, and then stabbed them in the back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","17:00"
"Donald Trump","He said, “Washington vultures.” I mean, think of it, all over, and they raked in cash. They raked in big money. Where’s his son? Where is he? Where’s his son? I’ll tell you. Where is he? What did I say, “Where is,” Where is he? Go ahead. You know, we did that for fun. Where’s Hunter? We did a t-shirt. That thing sold, we come up with these little gems. Where’s Hunter? You know where he is? Yeah. He’s in the basement with his father. Where’s Hunter? No, Hunter did very well. He had no job, he was thrown out of the military, he was thrown out. He had no job. And then he goes to Ukraine, and he gets $183,000 a month. Although he had no experience whatsoever, knew nothing about the subject of the company, which you know, was energy. I think they got an upfront payment of three million…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","18:03"
"Donald Trump","… energy. I think they got an upfront payment of three million just to be able to get them. Think of that, $183,000 a month and three million dollar upfront payment. How about that? I’d take that one myself. Then they go to China, he walks out with one point five billion to manage, which is millions of dollars a year. The whole thing is crazy and the fake news doesn’t want to cover it. They don’t want to cover it. Did you see the interview the other day with Anderson Cooper, the other night? That was softball, that was like, “Here, Joe.” So we’ll see. We have a debate coming up and who knows, look he’s been doing this … You know what, he’s been doing it for 47 years. I’ve been doing it for three and a half years, so he should be able to beat me I would think, he’s much more experienced. He’s great, oh, he’s a beauty. But he betrayed you, he lied to you, he abused you, which is why it’s time to retire Joe Biden, this is serious stuff. Do we have any Teamsters here? Teamsters, any Teamsters here? That’s all? One. All right, well, I did a big favor for the Teamsters, they had trucking company. I think 30,000 jobs going out. James Hoffa called up, “Could you help? Could you help? Could you help?” I helped, I kept that company going. They saved 30,000 jobs, but then every year they always endorse the Democrat, doesn’t matter, good or bad. And James Hoffa, I’m so disappointed in that guy. So I called, I said, “I’d love to get their support.” “Oh, I’m sorry, sir. They’ve already endorsed sleepy Joe Biden.” It’s like automatic, but you know who doesn’t endorse him, all the workers underneath and they’ll either throw him out or he’ll retire. He’ll retire. You get tired of it, it’s like automatic. They endorse the Democrat because the Democrats do whatever the hell they want. But the workers, the people underneath, the real people, they’re with us all the way.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","19:03"
"Donald Trump","I’ve hired thousands and thousands of Teamsters, all the concrete work on buildings in Manhattan. But they just like wedded. It’s almost like a habit. I consider it a habit and I think it’s disgraceful. But I saved this company, a big company, good company, great people. We saved it. And then you say unrelated, totally unrelated, “Hey, we’d love to have you.” “Well, I’m sorry, it’s already done.” These people are terrible, but that’s all right. You always have to remember things. Remember, you got to remember, right workers? On November 3rd, we must turn the page forever on the failed corrupt political class. That’s what it is. They get so much things that are so unfair to the rest of our country and that’s why they’re always with that top level of Democrat but the workers are with us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","21:15"
"Donald Trump","Biden is a diehard globalist. Globalists are out, you know that right? Globalist destroyed, they helped destroy this country. I’ll tell you if I didn’t come along, I really mean it. This country was, it was going down and we stopped it. If you look at your Second Amendment, if you look at so many different things, no matter what it is. You look at our jobs, our jobs prior to the plague and now coming back. The housing is record setting. Car manufacturing is record setting. You take a look at car sales are record setting. Retailing, who would think retail is record setting. It’s amazing because we had such a good foundation. We closed it up, we saved millions of lives. We had no choice, we had to do that. And then we opened it and now we’re rocking and it’s going good. It’s really going good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","22:04"
"Donald Trump","But the Democrats really waged war on the American workers for half a century. Look what they’ve done. Biden’s policies destroyed 60,000 factories and killed four point, think of it, four point five million manufacturing jobs. We brought back 700,000 when they said, right, they said the magic wand, you can’t do it, manufacturing jobs are gone. I said, “Really? I don’t think so.” Biden championed the NAFTA disaster and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which was a total catastrophe. That’s when China started going up like a rocket. They’re considered in the world trade, they’re considered a developing nation. No, they’re not a developing nation. By being a developing nation they get all sorts of advantages over us. So we’ve been protesting it and we do things that you wouldn’t believe. You don’t even want to hear about it because it’s disgraceful. China is a developing nation. And therefore for years and years, they had big advantages over the United States but no more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","22:58"
"Donald Trump","What followed was the nothing short, and think of it, nothing short of a blue collar carnage and it was in Ohio and Pennsylvania, and North Carolina, New Hampshire, Michigan. You know how many car plants we’re bringing back to Michigan. Nobody’s ever seen it. For 40 years, they didn’t build a plant. And now they’re building them all over. And I tell countries, I told a great gentleman, he just retired, Prime Minister Abe of Japan. I said, “Shinzo, you got to build plants here, you can’t do this. You’re building your cars in Japan and sending them. We want our cars built here. We want cars built here.” He said, “Well, that’s not up to me, that’s up to the company.” “That’s all right, Shinzo, I know you can do it.” The next day they announced five plants, I mean, what can I tell you?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","24:02"
"Donald Trump","I know my people, it’s up to Shinzo, it wasn’t up to anybody else, but he’s great. The workers of America will never forget Biden’s economic treachery. They will remember in November after Biden betrayed and think of it, all the betrayals on NAFTA and China, 40% of all of the manufacturing jobs were shipped out of Dayton. And now the good thing is your roads, you didn’t have a lot of traffic. So that’s the good news, everything else was bad, right? It was everything else was bad. 30,000 Dayton families saw their jobs disappear overnight. By 2016, the per capita income in Dayton had fallen 12% below the national average of $50,000. Remember this, this all happened … I mean, these numbers are incredible what’s happened in three years. Ohio lost one in three manufacturing jobs, two out of three iron and steel mill jobs. And half of its auto jobs, courtesy of Joe Biden and that crew, that group, that whole ideology.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","24:50"
"Donald Trump","And now of course his ideology has changed. He’s so far left that he is … just so you understand, he has no choice. It’s not him. He’s being pulled left. You see where Kamala, Kamala, she another great one that one. You see her poll numbers, her poll numbers were going down and I can’t … nobody treated him worse than Kamala, right? And she said the Harris administration and working with Joe Biden, did you see that? But he said worse, he said the Harris, right, he said the Harris, Biden administration. And I heard that, I actually heard that live, although it’s not real live, I’ll tell you. It’s sort of half gone, it’s shot, it’s shot. But he said the Harris, Biden administration will … and that’s where it is. Look, this guy is shot. I mean, if he makes it, it’s going to be … I’m going to come back to Dayton and I’m going to say what the hell happened?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","25:57"
"Donald Trump","I will have lost to the worst presidential candidate in the history of politics. I really believe that. The guy can’t speak without the teleprompter, although I’m telling you, I’m telling you, I think … she says [inaudible 00:27:10]. I hope you’re right. I hope you’re … Thank you. I hope you’re right. I tell you the country can’t afford it. One thing I’ve learned is that President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un, North Korea, every one of these leaders, they’re not shot. And we can’t have somebody that’s sleepy. We can’t have a sleepy guy negotiating. Oh, would they like to see him though? Did you see, would they like to see Joe? It’s their dream to see Joe. How about Iran, you think around might like to see Joe Biden? They’d go back, they say give me another $150 billion. We gave them 150 billion. We gave them one point eight billion in cash. You know what that looks like, one point eight billion in cash?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","26:58"
"Donald Trump","And I’ll tell you what, if and when we win, we will get a call within about nine seconds after the victory and it’ll be Iran, it’s going to want to make a deal. We want them to make a deal. We want them to be good. We want them to be strong. They just can’t have a nuclear weapon. That’s all, it’s very simple. You can’t have a nuclear weapon. But I told people, I said, “Don’t talk to them now, look, they want to wait.” This is the gift. If they could do that, if China could do it, I mean, think of it. If Russia could do it, by the way, nobody’s been tougher on Russia than me with the sanctions. With the … I exposed, right, Nord Stream 2, that’s the pipeline. No, you never heard of Nord Stream until I came along.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","28:01"
"Donald Trump","I said to Germany, let me get this straight. We defend Germany, right? We defend Germany and that’s it. They don’t pay what they’re supposed to pay, they’re delinquent, they’re delinquent. So I said to Angela and I like Angela, but I said, but she’s smart, why should she pay if she doesn’t have to. So I said, “Angela, so we defend you against Russia and you pay billions of dollars to Russia. How does that work? Explain to me what’s that all about?” But you never heard about that stuff. We’d give tank busters to Ukraine. We sell them in theory, I don’t know if we’ll ever get the money. We sell them. But he gave pillows, maybe he got them from Mike Lindell, the pillow man. You think when Obama sent pillows over to Ukraine, I send tank busters, they sent pillows. And the fake news goes, oh. Let me tell you, we have been very rough but at the same time we get along. I like Putin, he likes me. We get along. Wouldn’t you say it’s smart to get along, okay, it’s smart.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","28:45"
"Donald Trump","I get along or I got along with President Xi, but I don’t know, after what happened here I’m having a hard time with China, I really am. They’re buying a lot, the trade deal has been incredible. They have been living up to it in all fairness. The largest order of corn in the history of our country, largest order of soybeans, largest cattle order. But it means less now, you understand. If we wouldn’t have been hit with this pandemic, which they could’ve stopped, it would have meant a lot. But it just means a lot less to me right now. So now after selling you out and bleeding you dry, Biden is back asking for your vote. The guy, when he was in prime time, which for him was about halftime. Long time ago, I had a friend, a senator, a Democrat, believe it or not. I used to get along with Democrats very well, actually better than the Republicans, but I won’t say that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","29:51"
"Donald Trump","But I asked him, “Who’s your smartest senator?” And he gave me a name. This is 25 years ago. I said, “Who’s your dumbest Senator?” “Joe.” “Who’s Joe?” “Joe Biden.” Oh, I see, he is, really?” “Yeah, he’s the dumbest senator.” Well, now he’s a lot dumber than it used to be, I can tell you. It’s true. It’s true. It’s true. And you can take the gloves up because they do all this disinformation, they make up phony stuff. Like the military with what he said, I think it’s a disgrace and he should apologize. A source said. I have 27 people that said, no way, it didn’t happen. They said … and the names are out there. So when they do that, you take the gloves off, that’s all. Really dishonest people, dishonest people. No, it’s a disgrace.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","30:45"
"Donald Trump","And nobody’s done for the military what I’ve done. We’ve totally rebuilt our military. We’ve made it stronger than ever. We have the greatest weapons in the world. We’ve gotten raises for our great warriors. Our vet just got a 91% approval rating, the highest in the history of the V.A., our vets. They gave it a 91, the V.A., gave it a 91% approval rating. Nobody’s done more, nobody. And we do. We have weapons, the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before. Hope to God we don’t have to use them but nobody has them. Not China, not Russia, nobody has the weaponry that we have. We have the greatest weapons in the world and hopefully don’t have to use them. Just remember that, we have the … I call it the super-duper missiles, like at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. You don’t see them either. They go through here, they say, “Boy, what happened? What was that? It’s gone. It’s here. There it is. I hear a noise over there. Where is it?

But we have the greatest … two point five trillion dollars we spent. The greatest weapons in the world. The greatest weapons that this world has ever seen without a question, I don’t have to say what they are. In fact, the fake news said, “He just gave away classified information.” I said, “No, I just said we have the greatest weapons. I didn’t tell you what they are.” I could, because as president I’m allowed to do it.

"Donald Trump","Yeah, Hillary. And how about the idiot John Bolton? I mean, he comes in and all he wants to do is go to war with everybody. If I listened to that idiot, we’d be right now in World War Five. “Sir, we saw some movement in China. I think we should go to war with them. And I think Russia, let’s do them both at the same time. Let’s also go in right now to North Korea.” Hey, do you remember North Korea? We were supposed to be at war with North Korea. What happened? What happened? You know what the press said? They said, it’s amazing. First they said it was amazing and those people lost their job, probably. It’s amazing what I’ve done, they said. No, we’re supposed to be at war. They have a lot of nuclear stuff, it wouldn’t be easy.

And now it’s a beautiful brand new … we have F-35s that you can’t see. Stealth, they’re stealth. We have all new rockets, all new missiles, brand new planes, the bombers, the tankers, the jet fighters. What we’ve done is incredible. And we had to do it, somebody had to do it. Somebody said, well, we’re sort of doing some damage to our budget. I said, “Look, I want to have a strong military.” If I see some people, some soldiers from foreign lands, right, walking up or running up the White House lawn, the beautiful south lawn of the White House.

You know, it’s always [inaudible 00:35:36]. Joe Biden should not be asking for your support. He should be begging for your forgiveness and he should be. Biden supported the disastrous Trans-Pacific Partnership. This building wouldn’t be here if you ever did that one. Which would have been a death sentence for the U.S. auto industry and other industries. He supported the horrendous Korea deal, okay. How about the South Korea deal? It’s a disaster. So that was a Hillary Clinton deal, I must say, not him. Although I guess he had … he was vice, Hey, you know what’s interesting with Biden? So he always says, “Why didn’t the president do this. And why didn’t the president do that? And why didn’t do this and that, and this and that.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","35:24"
"Donald Trump","That’s been there for 47 years, but he just left like three and a half years ago. You know what I mean, he was there. And I keep saying, “Why didn’t you do it? Why didn’t you do it?” Could’ve done it. It’s not like he was 25 years ago. They were there three and a half years ago. Why didn’t you do it sleepy Joe? But the Korea deal and I say it all the time. She said, “This will create 250,000 jobs.” And everybody got all excited, oh, those jobs. The problem was the jobs were all produced in South Korea, so that didn’t work out to well. 250,000 jobs for South Korea. Anyway, I renegotiated the deal in its entirety, now it’s a good deal. That was a rip, I’ll tell you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","36:16"
"Donald Trump","And the pro-China Paris Climate Accord, it’s pro-everything, it’s pro-everybody but us. That would have cost us trillions of dollars, and we would have had the privilege of closing down Dayton’s … probably 25% of your companies. You could have never, you could have never done it. It’s an anti-America deal. And you know when I did it, I thought I’d be scorned. People understood that it was a total rip off. They understood it. With every decision, Joe Biden twisted a knife into the hands and heart of the American worker. But these brutal betrayals ended the day I took the oath of office, that’s true. I mean, I saw so much stupidity, the endless wars and we’re almost out of Afghanistan as you know. Not easy to get out because we have people in this country, the military industrial complex.

We’re down to very little in Iraq. We’re down to almost nothing in Syria, but I will be honest with you, we kept the oil. Somebody said, “You still have some soldiers in Syria?” I said, “That’s why they kept the oil.” We kept the oil. We should have done that in Iraq. Remember I used to say a long time ago before I was, “Don’t go into the Middle East, but if you’re going to go in and keep the oil.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","38:03"
"Donald Trump","Well, we went in and we didn’t keep anything and all the death, the blood in the sand, I call it the blood in the sand, that worthless sand. All of that death that has been caused for no reason. It was the worst decision in the history of our country going into the Middle East. We’re in there now $8 trillion, we’re almost out. $8 trillion and nothing but death and millions of lives if you look at both sides, I’ll look at both sides. Somebody would say, “Oh, I shouldn’t be looking at the other side. I look at both sides/ a lot of innocent people were killed. We lost incredible soldiers. I see the coffins, the caskets come in in Dover and I see it. And I said, “Oh boy, Why, why, why, why.

"Donald Trump","My first week, I withdrew from the transpacific partnership and saved that whole business of so much and what I had to do is I extended for a short time and then totally ended NAFTA. You know NAFTA’s the worst trade deal ever made? Ever made. And we did the USMCA, Mexico, Canada. We have a great deal. And the reason I know it’s a great deal because the other sides are unhappy. You always liked to have an unhappy person at the other sides. No, they’re okay.

"Donald Trump","How many buildings, how many factories did you lose right here? Where they moved over to Mexico, moved up to Canada, moved all over the place, but that’s not going to happen anymore. The new deal makes it very prohibitive to do that. In 2017, I signed a historic executive order making it really something. You got to do a couple of little expressions it’s called buy American and hire American. You know life is crazy in politics. Biden runs for president like two or three times, right?

But had if Elizabeth Warren left and been loyal to her communist ideology, dare say socialist, but it’s communist. It was pretty close. Maybe somewhere in-between heading toward the C-word. But had she left before Super Tuesday, Biden would’ve lost every state, but she took the votes away from Bernie. And Bernie is a nice guy, you know Crazy Bernie. He is the nicest loser I’ve ever seen.

The only spirit he’s got is spirit to beat me. And that’s called the negative spirit. And historically that doesn’t do that well. If you look at old races when somebody’s getting votes because they don’t like somebody, you know there’s an ideology that let’s face it doesn’t like me too much.

And the head of Whirlpool came to see me. I was president-elect and he called and I don’t know, for some reason I’ve heard of Whirlpool and I’ve heard of it all my life, I guess.

They dump them into our market. They put everybody out of business. Then they charge you a lot of money when everyone’s gone. Just like Rockefeller used to do, right? Just like other people do right now, unfortunately, but we’re trying to track them down. And I said, “That’s really terrible.” I don’t know. Somehow it hit me. So we put a 50% tariff on all washing machines coming into our country. And I visited with Jim Jordan.

But I evened up the score, I put the tariffs and now what they’re doing is LG and Samsung, and these companies that made the washing machine they’re now coming into the United States. And in order to avoid the tariff, they’re building plants in the United States and that’s okay and that’s what we should be doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","44:45"
"Donald Trump","We’re going to be doing it a lot more too. We’re going to be doing it a lot more. Biden allowed other countries to target our steel industries and it was like a disaster for our steel industry, but we took historic action to end these practices and place strong tariffs on foreign aluminum and steel. And it brought back our steel. Now steel plants are opening or being upgraded in Toledo, Marion, Cuyahoga Heights, Mingo Junction, and all across the Midwest.

And they poisoned our communities with fentanyl. You know that? Instead, Biden allowed China to ravage our towns, raid our factories and rip apart our communities. That’s what they did.

And then he takes ads. “He’s going to be tough on China.” This guy, they looted him and Obama. And in all fairness, not just the eight years, this has gone on for 25, 30 years.

All of the things, we could go on forever. But Biden vowed to remove those tariffs. He wants to remove the tariffs. You know when I made the deal with China, I said I have to leave the tariffs on. They said, “You got to be kidding.” They wanted one thing, the removal of the tariffs, and I wouldn’t do it. We wouldn’t do it.

They all said, “We’ve got to do it sometime.” They told me that. I mean, they told me that loud and clear. We didn’t lose anything with the farmers. They said, “Somebody’s got to do it.” And I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to let them target you. They’re going to stop buying.

It’s lucky I liked it because I never did it before. They said, “He can’t run. He’s got no experience.” And now that I look around yesterday, I was in the Oval Office, I said, “Oh, excuse me. Is this the Oval Office?” No, but a lot of it’s common sense. It’s all common sense. That’s why we call it protest. We’re studying some of the things. I’ll tell you one quick story. So we’re building an aircraft carrier long before my term, the Gerald Ford. And they decide on the catapults. You know the catapult? That throws the plane into the air.

"Donald Trump","You ever see those airplanes? They go off. They catapult. So I noticed that this ship is never getting done. I came in and they said, “Oh, it’s got tremendous cost overruns.” I said, “What’s the problem?” Well, the catapult system doesn’t work.” “That’s strange because they’ve been building them for years. I wonder why.” You know about this. And I said, “Strange, let me check.” So anyway, I’m supposed to go over and take a tour. I went to take a tour of the ship, find out why it’s so late. I won’t tell you how many billions of dollars it’s over budget. Billions and billions of dollars. But I heard the catapult system and the elevators are no good. Other than that, it’s wonderful. Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","54:43"
"Donald Trump","The elevators that bring the planes up, they don’t work. So if you have a problem, you can get your plans up. They’re down stuck in a garage, down at the bottom. Not too good. So I go over and they want me to meet the admiral, but I said, “No, no, no. I don’t want to meet the admiral yet.” I meet with the admirals a lot. I got a lot of admirals. I like the admirals. “I want to meet with the catapultors.” “Sir, why would you want to meet with the catapultors for?” “I want to find out why the hell the catapults don’t work.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","55:21"
"Donald Trump","So I went there and you know they did a new system. It’s electric, it’s all electric. So instead of steam, which is simple and great and powerful and good. And they know how it works for years and years, they decided to go all electric. Now if you take a little glass of water, take this glass of water, you throw it and that’s the end of that. You bring somebody in from MIT, how the hell do you fix it? And we’re dealing with the ocean and rockets being shot at the ship and the rough stuff. Right? But it wasn’t working.

"Donald Trump","So there were five people that came in. One’s been doing it for over 20 years I think he said. I said, “Who’s the boss?” “I am, sir.” I said, “What do you think of our new system of electric catapults?” “Sir, it’s no good, sir.” I said, “That’s not good.” That’s actually it is what I expected it to be on. I said, “So, it’s no good. Right? The system is no good?” “No, sir.” I said, “What do you think of steam?” “Sir, it’s the greatest. That if it breaks down, I can fix it with a blowtorch or this hammer, I can fix it. And if the waves hit it, sir, all it does is cool it down a little bit, sir. It’s actually good for it, good for the surrounding steel.” I said, “So you think it’s better?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","56:21"
"Donald Trump","Surrounding steel. I said, “So you think it’s better?” I said, “Why did they do the electric?” Because they are totally inexperienced. Then I wanted to see the architect and I saw a representative, the architect of ship. Now this is a ship that costs $15 billion. And I looked at the architect. I said, “Have you designed a ship before?” And he said, “Yeah, I have.” I said, “You know, they have a $900 million cost overrun for electric catapults, and they’re no good even if they were.” I said to the guy, “Why is it that they did away?” “Sir, we could do it much faster. The thing goes back and forth.” I said, “All right, well, that makes sense.” But the catapulter said, “But sir, it doesn’t matter because it takes one minute and 52 seconds, if you’re Mario Andretti’s team, to get a plane hooked in. So the steam generates during that minute and a half and it’s all set to go. It doesn’t help that it keeps going back and forth.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","57:03"
"Donald Trump","I said, “That makes sense. That makes sense.” So it’s $900 million in cost overruns and here’s the story. They spent much more money and it’s no good. Then they have the elevators. Now, tractors use hydraulic, right? You know, they could do anything. Lift up. They go. It can rain. It can snow. Lightning hits the damn thing and nothing happens. The lightning gets hurt. Nothing happens. So they have these big elevators that lift the planes up. You know, the sirens go off. Everything’s beautiful. The problem is the elevators don’t work. So they’re magnetized. They’re lifted by magnets. I said, “Who the hell ever heard?” I know about that. You know, it’s a new technology that’s about 200 years off.

So they have hundreds of millions of dollars in cost overrun for stuff that’s no good. And two years ago I told them it’s no good. You might as well rip it out because it’s never going to work. You put hydraulic in the elevators and you go back to steam and it’s such a shame to see the kind of money that was squandered by people that have no idea what the hell they’re doing. It’s a shame. Yeah. It’s a shame. And you would understand that. I’d only tell that story to really sort of a group like this because you guys understand it. It’s mechanical engineering at a very easy level. It’s easy to understand. Hundreds of millions of dollars wasted for something not as good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","58:55"
"Donald Trump","For decades. Our politicians spent trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign Wars, and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities. We are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","59:44"
"Donald Trump","When the terrible plague arrived from China, we mobilized American industry like never before. We rapidly developed lifesaving therapies reducing the fatality rate by 85%. We’ve done such a good job, except in terms of public relations because the press just will not accept that. Think of what we’ve done with the ventilators. Soon, soon, the vaccines and the therapeutics, Remdesivir and other things. Europe is almost 30% greater excess mortality than the United States. They don’t want to say it. And now, as you know, you heard today, Europe had a tremendous outbreak. Okay. You know, they say, “Well, Europe, Europe, Europe.” No, we’re doing great. We’re doing great. Sadly, very sadly, I hate it, but they had a big outbreak that caused a stir in the market today. We launched the most ambitious vaccine program ever created. And we will deliver a vaccine before the end of the year, but it could be a lot sooner than that, a lot sooner.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:00:11"
"Donald Trump","You know, it’s interesting. The Democrats, they’re all saying, “We want a vaccine.” That’s when they thought we couldn’t get it, right? Because if we relied on them, this vaccine would have taken two or three years more because of the FDA, and I’ve mobilized the FDA, and it’s incredible. But it would have taken two or three years more. So when they heard that we were getting the vaccine, they started knocking it. Think of it. So they put politics over life and death. I mean, it’s incredible. By the way, we’re rounding the corner in any event, but we’re going to have a vaccine very soon, is a great vaccine, great, great vaccine. It’s looking really good, really good. And it’s going to be a lot sooner than anyone thought. And it’s pretty sad when the Democrats try and make that into a political issue. Because they’re unhappy. It’s coming too soon. They didn’t think that would happen. We will end this pandemic in the next year. Will be one of the greatest years of the history of our country. That’s what’s happening. The third quarter will end just before November 3rd. You will see numbers, the likes of which no country has ever seen. That’s how well we’re doing. You’ll see. And if it’s before, so, they’re not good. I guess you’re going to have to remember that. And if they’re good, I hope you’re going to remember it too, but they’re going to be great. Somebody predicted 25% and then somebody said 35% GDP increase. Nobody’s ever heard of a number like that. But that’s the kind of thing we’re doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:01:14"
"Donald Trump","Under my leadership, we built the strongest economy in the history of the world, and now we are doing it again. In the past four months, we’ve added a record smashing 10.6 million jobs, never been close to that. Four months, 10.6 million jobs. Manufacturing production is up 61%. auto production has surged 500%. And retail sales have soared 112%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:02:40"
"Donald Trump","But if sleepy Joe Biden wins, the economy will collapse. It’s going to collapse. Even psychologically it’ll collapse. And you know, as good as the stock market’s doing, it’s a headwind knowing you have an election. Things happen in elections, some bad things, some stupid things. But that’s a headwind. We’d be doing even better if this election were over. If we win and when we win the election, you’re going to see things roar because that’s what people want. That’s what the market wants. And that’s what the workers want. Biden keeps talking about a nationwide shutdown. There is no shutdown. My plan is to crush the virus. Biden plan and Biden’s really plan is to, and it’s not that he wants to crush America, but he will just out of gross incompetence. Biden will surrender to the virus, just like he surrendered to China.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:03:20"
"Donald Trump","And just like he surrendered to the radical left, including his own running mate who’s running the show. And she’s nothing special. She is nothing. Between her and Elizabeth Warren, what a couple of great ones. What a couple of, what some people? Well, I’ll tell you something. Elizabeth Warren did do a great number on Bloomberg. Didn’t she? I tell you. One question and that was the end of him. How you enjoying politics, Mike? That didn’t work out too well. $1.8 billion wiped out in one question. That was the most expensive question in history.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:04:10"
"Donald Trump","To protect our workers during the pandemic, I suspended the entry of new foreign workers who threatened American jobs. I know you don’t mind. You don’t mind that, do you folks? As the economy reopens, I want to ensure American workers that we’re putting America first and our jobs are put first. Our country is put first. Our manufacturing is put first. Everything is now put first for the USA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:04:46"
"Donald Trump","And by the way, we’re up to mile 330 on the wall. We’re setting records on not allowing all of these. I mean, some really bad. When you look at the traffickers. They traffic in women and drugs and other things, but they traffic in women, the drug dealers always. Setting records now on the wall because we have 330 miles. We’re averaging 10 miles a week and we’ll be finished with the wall very soon. And it’s had a huge impact.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:05:15"
"Donald Trump","So one of the most radical things that will happen, and there’s no way he can get away with this because he was banning fracking for a year. He’s running, running, he’s banning fracking. I said, “He’s gone. He’s gone.” And then all of a sudden, now all of sudden he said, “Well, I didn’t really say that.” He did. Remember, it’s always the first thing they say with a politician. It’s the first thing. He wants to ban fracking and outlaw Ohio energy production.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:06:06"
"Donald Trump","And you’re a big energy producer, whether you know it or not. So he’s going to ban fracking. There’s no question about it. And even if he didn’t want to, the whole radical left, their plan is to ban fracking. They want to ban fracking. They don’t want any fossil fuels. Just a few days ago, Biden reiterated his plan to require net zero carbon emissions. So you do that. I think it’s wonderful. Close up about 70% of your plants. This requirement would end all investment in fracking and it would just shut down everything. Our country, do you see the rolling blackouts they have in California? I don’t think we want too many of them in Ohio. Do we? Would anybody like a few rolling blackouts? Like we’d like to watch president Trump tonight. I’m sorry, darling, but we have no energy. We have no energy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:06:33"
"Donald Trump","We’re going to get it from the wind. The wind is blowing. The wind, the wind has got a wonderful, wonderful energy. The wind, when it’s blowing it’s just fine for about 20% of the time. By ending fracking, Biden would destroy 700,000 to a million Ohio jobs and your energy prices would go through the roof. When Biden was Vice President, they deliberately killed 40% of all coal mining jobs and the rest were coming fast. I saved it. I put our miners back to work, clean coal. I call it clean coal. Can do a lot with coal. And while I’m President, America will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world and Ohio workers will continue leading the way. And that’s what we’re doing. And just in concluding, over the next four years, we will build America into the manufacturing, super power of the world. And we will end our reliance on China and all other faraway lands that nobody in this beautiful facility, whatever the hell you make here, I don’t know, but it looks good to me. But nobody ever heard of it. You have lands that would go to that nobody ever even heard of. Where are you sending this money? We’re sending it to such and such a country. I never heard of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:07:25"
"Donald Trump","We’ll make our medical supplies right here in the United States. We’ll cut your taxes and taxes for middle class families at a level never seen before. You know, we gave you the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. We gave you the biggest regulation cut in the history of our country. And we’re going to give you additional regulation cuts. That’s one of the reasons you had the jobs. You know, in many ways, the regulation cutting was perhaps as important or more important. You see the tax cutting easier, but the regulation cutting was every bit as important. And we’re going to expand opportunity zones to ensure that no community is left behind. And they’ve been a tremendous success, especially for the African American, Hispanic community. We’re doing incredible. Tim Scott, great Senator from South Carolina. We worked hard on it. Opportunities zones. It’s a big success.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:08:42"
"Donald Trump","We’ll enforce immigration rules that defend American families, raise American wages, and always put the interests of American workers first. We will enact fair trade deals that ensure more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase Made in the USA, right? And we will always live by the timeless words of our national motto: In God We trust. And they took the word God out of the Pledge of Allegiance. You saw that. I was listening to this Pledge of Allegiance and I said, “That’s strange. They must’ve made a mistake. It must’ve been a typo. Something happened.” But then it happened twice. And then it was getting ready to happen a third time, and somebody heard that the public was enraged, including me by the way. And by the way, we want the NFL to stand and put their hand on their heart. Got to do it. Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:09:43"
"Donald Trump","I thought we taught them that lesson about two years ago. The commissioner tried it again. It’s not working too well. Not working. The ratings are not good. People are angry about it. People love our country. You love our country. You love our flag. You love our anthem. This November, if you want jobs, if you want opportunity, if you want safety, and if you want a President who defends the dreams of workers in Dayton and Akron and all across Ohio in America, then you need to get out and vote for Trump, Mike Pence. How good is Mike Pence? Trump Pence. And I love Mike, but it’s not Pence Trump, okay? You understand? It’s not Pence. Mike will be the first one to say. You know, when he said that the other day. He said the Harris Biden administration. I said, “That’s strange.” And Mike called me up. He said, “You never have to do that.” I said, “Don’t worry, Mike. I won’t. I promise.” Mike Pence has done a great job. I’ll tell you. He’s a great guy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:11:10"
"Donald Trump","Together we will make America safer. We will make America stronger and prouder and greater than ever before. We’re going to make it greater than ever before. And again, this was not a rally. This was a group of people, workers, and this is what it was told to me as, and we had a lot of fun and we have a lot of fun, but it’s very serious business. November 3rd and before, depending on whether or not you have those fake ballots or whatever. Be careful with that. I mean, that thing is going to be one of the great catastrophes. What a mess. And they want it to be a mess. They know it’s no good. I think it’s 11 different races. When they have small races, they can’t account. People steal the ballots. People don’t get the ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:12:13"
"Donald Trump","They don’t send them to a Republican area or maybe a Democrat area, whatever, it’s still wrong. But it happens to be Republican, unfortunately. But they don’t send them out. Then they harvest them, which they’re not allowed to do. They have in Nevada, the Governor said he signed an order that they don’t have to sign. We need no signature verification. Oh, that’s great. Because they couldn’t get people to sign, so they said, “We’ll just send them in. Don’t worry about it.” This is a real affront to our democracy. This is a horrible thing that’s going on. And the Democrats know it and they say, “Well, he’s not for our great heritage. He is fighting our vote.” No I’m not fighting our vote. You have ballots that you go out and you can get, you could request as you know, you can request them and that’s fine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:12:55"
"Donald Trump","But if you’re not requesting them, when you get millions of ballots, 80 million they say all over the United States, where the hell are they going? Who’s sending them? Who is getting them? Who’s sending them back? What’s happening with the transportation? Who’s guarding the lockboxes? They know it’s a fraud waiting to happen. But you know, we’re not talking about 1%, which is no good, because you could lose or win an election by 1%, we’re talking about 20%, 30% in one case, over 40%. This is a disgrace that they’re allowed to get away with. And what they want to do is they want to have a mess at the end of the evening on November 3rd and then fight it out in the courts. And the Democrats should be ashamed of themselves because they know what they’re causing. We love Ohio. We love Dayton. God bless you. God bless Ohio. And God bless America. Thank you. Thank you, everybody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-speech-transcript-vandalia-ohio-september-21","Donald Trump Campaign Speech Transcript Vandalia, Ohio September 21","01:13:48"
