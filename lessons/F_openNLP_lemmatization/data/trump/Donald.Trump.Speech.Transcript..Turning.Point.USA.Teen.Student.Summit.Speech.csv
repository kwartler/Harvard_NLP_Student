There have been some pretty good movements, and they won New Hampshire, or they won the state, some place, but they didn’t win the whole ball game. You saw what we won.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","16:50"
"Donald Trump","And you could see it. We could feel it. We knew it was going to happen, because it’s a movement about reclaiming your future, rebuilding your country, and restoring your destiny, and renewing the values that are the true source of American greatness. We lost those values, and we’re getting them back rapidly. We’re getting them back rapidly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","17:28"
"Donald Trump","Just backstage, a gentleman, very rich gentleman in this case, came up sitting in one of these rows, I assume. Yeah. There he is. He said, “Sir, thank you for saving our country.” And I said, “Thank you very much.” I said, “Thank you very much.” And I looked at Charlie. And I said, “Charlie, do you have any idea how many people say that?” I gave the commencement address at the Air Force Academy recently, and Indianapolis the year before. And they said, “Sir, would you like to shake the hands of all the cadets?” I said, “How many are there?” “1,100.” I said, “Yeah, that sounds okay.” I say, “Do other Presidents do it?” “Yes, they do.” “Do all of them?” “yeah, they do.” What they didn’t say is they start and then they beat around, and then they go back, because it’s tough. It was really hot. That sun was beaming down, and I’m just one hand. Some of these guys are great athletes. Some of the women, they had some women in the class that were … their hands were very strong, okay? And they were all shaking it. They’re a little nervous meeting the President. They’re shaking strongly and … sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","17:47"
"Donald Trump","But with shaking 1,100 hands, and saluting, was saluting, shaking, turning, spinning. They come at all different directions. Felt like a great fighter pilot. But, I stood up there for the whole thing. I said, “There’s no way that other Presidents have done that.” He said, “No, no, they do it, but they leave after about 50 or 60 people.” I said, “Why didn’t you tell me that?” But I’m glad I did it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","19:03"
"Donald Trump","But, I did the same thing. I did the same thing at Annapolis the year before, great place. Just great. And I shook the hands of, I think, 1,011 at Annapolis, and it’s really something great. But, so many of these young incredible people, they’re like you, so many of these young incredible people, they come, “Sir, thank you for saving America.” “Sir, thank you for saving America.” “Sir, thank you for saving our country.” So many of them, it’s not rehearsed. It’s just that’s what they feel.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","19:25"
"Donald Trump","And you know what? Someone had to do what I did. It’s not pleasant. We have a deep state. We have banned people. We have sick people. I watched just this morning this Tlaib from Michigan, right? It’s a great state. We won Michigan. There is no way she stands for the values of the people of Michigan. But, I watched her this morning. She’s vicious. She’s like a crazed lunatic. She’s screaming. This is before she got into Congress. Who elected her? She’s screaming like a total lunatic at one of our rallies. It’s like I’m giving a little rally, and she starts screaming.

Not that AOC is a bargain, because she’s not. She’s no bargain. Look. We’ll go into it at some point. I’ll tell you all about AOC. I’ve got more on AOC. AOC. AOC.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","20:47"
"Donald Trump","But, what’s going on with that party, having to embrace them, and your other friend from an incredible state, right? A state that I’m going to win, Minnesota. You know that one. And you know why I’m going to win the state? Because of her. I almost won it last time. We came within just about a point. That’s a very … because Minnesota’s a very hard one for a Republican to win. We almost won it, one more night. I wanted to go there one more time. I said, “I’m telling you, we’re going to win Minnesota.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","21:16"
"Donald Trump","You know who thought I was going to win Minnesota? You know who thought I was going to win Michigan, and Wisconsin, and North Carolina? Bill Clinton. He was telling everybody, “You better be careful.” He told people, from what I hear, he said, “The one you don’t want to run against is Trump.” And they said, “Why? Oh no, that’s good. We want to run against Trump.” No, no, you don’t.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","21:47"
"Donald Trump","You know, I actually knew him pretty well. We got along very well, until I decided to run for office. We actually got along. But, they didn’t want to listen to him. But, he was the only one with the instinct. The rest didn’t have. So, he came back and he said, “You know, he’s doing very well in Michigan. You could have a problem.” They said, “No, don’t worry about Michigan. We haven’t lost Michigan in decades.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","22:08"
"Donald Trump","And he came back. He said, “You know, he was in Wisconsin, or something.” But he said he hears that I’m doing well in Wisconsin. They say, “Forget it. A Republican can’t win Wisconsin.” And then we won Wisconsin. Then he came back. And I say this with a certain old time affection, because I had a very good relationship with him before doing this. Now it’s a little harder for him to have a good relationship.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","22:29"
"Donald Trump","But, he said, “You don’t want to run against Trump. Don’t run against Trump.” Everybody said, “No, no. That’s okay. We like him.” Remember, President Obama? “He will not win. He will not win.” Okay? He goes, “Liar.” Yeah. Hey, did Obama get a Pinocchio? That’s right. Obama said, “He will not win. He will not be your President.” The anger was unbelievable. You know what? He’s right. He was a liar. Did you give Obama a Pinocchio Washington Post? He said, “He will not win.” These papers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","22:58"
"Donald Trump","These papers are so bad. So yesterday, we had a story in one of the papers that I thought was good, but they’re really not. When you analyze it, there’s almost not too many of them that are. The wall. We’re building a lot of wall. But, let me just tell you. But, there are areas where they have walls that are falling down, walls that are in such bad shape. We’re trying to renovate it as much as we can. And we have a provision. We can renovate, but we can’t build new.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","23:34"
"Donald Trump","So, we’re taking all these years, and generally speaking, when you have an old wall that’s falling down, it’s in a better location for a wall. That’s why they had it there in the first place, as opposed to an area that’s empty. Typically, that would be true. So, these walls are old. They’re crumbling. They’re of no use. They’re falling down. So, we rip it up, build brand new foundations, pour brand new beautiful footings, and take a wall that’s two or three feet high, mostly laying on the ground, some of it only for cars, to stop cars from coming, of course. Just a metal spike.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","24:02"
"Donald Trump","So we would rip it out, figure it would take about a minute, and we put in deep foundation seven feet deep, and we put in 30 foot bollards, and then loaded it up with concrete, because inside, I like doing it. One of the reasons, they said, “But, you said you’re going to build a concrete wall.” Well, so actually inside the steel, we have it. So we have both. We have steel and we have concrete.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","24:33"
"Donald Trump","And I was saving that for later, because the only thing they can do is, “He’s building a steel wall. It’s not concrete.” Oh, sorry about that, folks. And you do have to have vision. It’s very important. You can’t just have a blank wall. You have to have vision. It’s much better for security to have the vision.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","24:52"
"Donald Trump","Anyway, so we’re building the wall. So, they come out with, “Donald Trump has built almost no wall.” What a lie that is, and we’re building 50 miles here, 50 miles there, 50 all in the right locations, because there used to be walls, but then we had to take them down. In some cases, if they’re good enough, we’re renovating, because we can do it for a lot less money. But generally, some of these walls are worthless. Literally, you just drive right over them. They’re laying down on their side.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","25:09"
"Donald Trump","They gave me no credit. If you ready the story, they’ll say, “Well, he has renovated a lot of wall.” Well, that’s not even a renovation. Let’s face it. That’s a brand new wall. It’s all a brand new wall. It just shows you how dishonest this fake news is, and this is what we have to deal with. This is really what we have to deal with. But, get used to it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","25:39"
"Donald Trump","Many of you will be in politics. Just get used to it, okay? Get used to it. Together, is this true?

They will do damage to the Second Amendment, the likes of which nobody even thought of. That’s where they’re coming from. Just remember, I said it. Hopefully, they never get the chance.

"Donald Trump","And we know that strong nations must have strong borders, and we’re building a strong border against so much. You have no idea. Every time I announce, as an example, a section of wall, I get lawsuits. They sue me. You know who sues me? Congressmen. Congressmen. I get sued by Nancy Pelosi. We won that suit. Can you believe it? I won one. We won a couple of them, but we have suits on the border. We had one judge. They always sue in the ninth circuit.

"Donald Trump","They sue in the ninth circuit, which is sort of like an automatic victory, although we did win one last week in the ninth circuit. No one can even believe it. Can you? You know what’s happening, right? Do you know what’s happening? So as of today, this is so important, there are those that say it’s the most important. I would say war and peace and security, that’s the most important.

So, we have two already. And they’re great, and they’re good. But, what people don’t talk about, I’ve just signed the 124th federal district judge, federal judges underneath. And within a couple of months, I’ll be up to 147. Think of that. 147. Because normally, when you become President, you go in, and you say, “Do I have any judges to appoint?” No. Because it’s such an important thing.

They’re better than that then they are at policy. Look at their policy. They want open borders, which means crime, which means drugs and human trafficking, which is a phenomenon that you would think is thousands of years old, and that would’ve been their prime. No, the prime is now because of the internet. Women, mostly women, are being trafficked, and they got not only in this country, all over the world. It’s never been like this before. Human trafficking, they snatch women, and they traffic women, and they sell women, and we can’t get the Democrats to even give us a modicum of the money we need at the border, especially for the wall.

How do you give a contract out where you have a contractor, and he’s got to build 67 miles of wall? We have one case, but we’re being sued, our funding source, because we’re taking it from a certain area, and so, we’re being sued. So, we have to wait for the suit. I mean, how would you like to be building like this? Not good, it’s not good, but we’re getting it done anyway, but they should say, “It’s not working without the wall. You got to have the wall. You got to have … ” When they bum rush you, they did that last week. They rushed in a tremendous large number of people. By the way, you know why they’re coming up right?

That’s all I have to tell you, and they went back. So, we’re going to do either tariffs, or we’re going to do a form of tax, or we’re going to use our ban. People don’t realize we won the ban.

These are the values that inspire hundreds of thousands of Turning Point usa members and more than 1400 college and high school campuses in all 50 states. It’s incredible what’s been done with Turning Point and the job, Charlie, and everybody. I met all of the people backstage just a little while ago. These are people that love our country. It’s amazing what they’ve done, the job they’ve done and in a pretty short period of time. And I was telling Charlie, too, and I’ve said it before, ” Remember, you are not in the minority. Most people are with you.” There was a young woman today. I saw her on a beauty pageant, and she has conservative values, and the pageant, which used to compete against my pageant … I did much better, but that’s okay. I had the Miss Universes. This is a different company, but I sold it.

"Donald Trump","But when you run for office, owning a beauty pageant is not the greatest idea. Do we agree? Owning the Miss Universe and Miss usa and Miss Teen usa, by the way, was not exactly good with maybe running for president. So, we sold it to IMG, but what they did to this young lady was terrible, and she was on Fox and Friends this morning wearing a Make America Great Again hat, which was pretty cool, which was pretty cool. Each of you is coming of age at a time of unlimited possibility. It’s true, better than, I think, ever before. We have the hottest economy on the planet Earth, and I was elected. We’ve created more than six million new jobs. More than seven million Americans have been lifted off of food stamps, think of that. Unemployment for young Americans age 16 to 19 has reached the lowest rate in over half a century. The unemployment rates for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Wages are rising, and they’re growing fastest for blue collar workers. Isn’t that great, though? People don’t talk about that. Young people have seen their wages rise by more than 10%.

If our opponent, if my opponent won, instead of having record stock markets and record employment numbers, you would’ve been in, in my opinion, a major recession, if not a depression. You would’ve gone down like a rock. Look what happened right after the election. The stock market was like a rocket ship because of enthusiasm. People wanted to have us win. It’s not me. It’s us. It’s all of us. It’s a movement. It’s us, and the market [inaudible 00:40:35]. We cute our record number of job-killing regulations. We passed historic tax cuts so that our industries can compete and win against anyone in the world.

Think of it. 60,000, you would say, “How is that possible?” You get a map, take 60,000 … You would say it’s impossible. 60,000 factories, plants, companies destroyed. Not destroyed, they went a different way. They were given no incentives to stay here. Some of the dumbest legislation ever passed, NAFTA. The World Trade Organization has been a horrible thing for us. That’s what built China. That and the fact that our former presidents did nothing about the fact that China was making hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and I guess they didn’t see it. I mean, 25 years they didn’t see it, but we see it, and right now, they’re paying us billions and billions of dollars, folks, billions. And they want to make a deal badly, and we’ll see whether or not we’ll make a deal. We’ll see. We’ll see, but our farmers are being helped. I said to our secretary of agriculture, Sonny Perdue, because China, very smart. I don’t blame them. Look, I’m not blaming them. I blame our past leaders for allowing it to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","41:03"
"Donald Trump","I’m not blaming China. We should’ve done that to them. I blame our past leaders. I said that to President Xi of China. I said it, but I said to Sonny Perdue, “So, Sonny, they’re targeting us.” They said. They actually took ads in the Des Moines register, anti-Trump. I love Iowa, too. It says Iowa loves you. I love Iowa. Well, ethanol is doing pretty well in Iowa, too, right? But they took ads in the Iowa papers, and it was anti-Trump ads, right? And then, they stopped buying a lot of the product, almost everything. They stopped buying from our farmers because they knew that was my strength. The whole middle of the country is red. You saw that in the clip. That clip was fantastic. By the way, Charlie, that clip was so good, I would’ve rather seen it a second time, and I could’ve come on a little bit later. I like it, but that clip was great. But you see, the whole center’s all bright red, meaning Republican, all read, and just those little edges are blue. So, they targeted the red. Nobody’s said China’s stupid, and they said, “We’re not going to buy product.” And essentially, they really closed it up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","42:22"
"Donald Trump","So, we’re taking in billions of dollars in tariffs from China. They never gave us 25 cents, and I said to my Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue’s great, I said, “Sonny, what’s the biggest year that we’ve ever had with China? How much money did they spend in the United States?” “Sir, I’ll get back to you.” He gets back to me the next day. “Sir, $16 billion.” I say, “All right. We’ll take $16 billion out of our tariffs,” which are many times that amount that they are paying us in tariffs. They never paid us 25 cents. We’ll take $16 billion out. That’s the highest they’ve ever paid, and we’ll use that toward the farmers and distribute it. This way, nobody gets hurt. And no other president’s doing that for the farmers, or no other president’s going to save the miners and save energy. We’re the number one producer of energy now in the world, and when I came, it was heading in the wrong direction. It was heading in a very bad direction. Right now, we’re bigger than Russia and bigger than Saudi Arabia and bigger than anybody. And we know that our first duty and our one true allegiance is to the American nation and to the American citizen, the usa.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","43:37"
"Donald Trump","Loyalty to our people is our guiding light. It’s our north star and our unwavering conviction. We have secured record funding to build up awesome might for the United States military because we know the best way to prevent conflict is to be prepared for it. So, when you’re strong, strong, strong, it’s okay. They’re going to leave you alone. They said, “Let’s pass.” We had a depleted military. We built up our military. We had jets so well they didn’t fly. We had a large percentage of fighter jets that were out. We had that old Navy. We’re building brand new submarines, brand new ships. We’re building tremendous F35s, F18s. We’re building a military, the likes of which even we have never had because we have to. New missiles, we make the greatest equipment in the world. I hate to mention this word, but we’re renewing and renovating our nuclear arsenal like never before, and we hope to God that we never have to use it. That’s what I say. We hope to God we never have to use it, but we have to have it ready. We have to have it as a horrible, to me, the most horrible alternative that can happen is that, but we have nuclear, the likes of which nobody’s ever had, like we have, and all pray that we never have to use it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","44:55"
"Donald Trump","Our agenda is pro-worker and pro-family. We’re making childcare more affordable, expanding access to vocational education, so important, and our pledge to America’s workers had secured commitments to provide more than nine million apprenticeships and job opportunities for industries all over the country. We’re helping people get jobs. We’re helping Walmart and so many companies. They went out. They went all out. They went all out, and they’re working. And they’re working with a person you may have heard of, perhaps not, Ivanka Trump. She loves it. She loves it. She loves it. I’ll tell you, she didn’t need it. She loves it. More than anything, that’s what she loves because she says we’re providing so many jobs, and they’re training people. And the government can’t really train them. When you go into these big companies, the Caterpillars and all of these, you’ve got to sort of be trained by the people that do it, the complexity, the aerospace. Lockheed Martin has been great. Boeing has been great. There’s so many, and they can train much better than the government. The government, really, wouldn’t know where to begin. So, they’re training. We’re going to have close to 10 million very shortly, and Ivanka really has done an incredible job on that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","46:35"
"Donald Trump","I might as well give her credit because the media will never give her credit. She’s my daughter. I’ll give her credit, but it’s true, and you know what? If she didn’t do a good job, I don’t know that I’d say that, but I wouldn’t be talking about her. That I can tell you. I’d probably just fluff over it. She’s done an incredible job. There’s truly never been a better time to be young and American. There’s never been a better time because our future is the brightest than it’s ever been. A new poll only … You’ve got to hear this. How about this whole witch hunt that’s going on? Should I talk about it for a second?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","47:57"

"Donald Trump","The Russian witch hunt, okay? First of all, it’s very bad for our country. Makes it very hard to deal with Russia, and we should be able to. They’re a nuclear power. They have a big country, and we should be able to deal with them without having this artificial stuff, but think of it. Only 11% in a new poll favor the starting of this ridiculous impeachment hearings that are going on. You hear about it. So, I said this morning, I wrote it out. I said, “Let’s see,” because I’m watching. It goes on for years and years and years, no collusion, no obstruction. Oh, that’s not good enough. Let’s go more. $40 million dollars, interview 500 people, they’ve got nothing. I could find something. I could take anybody in this audience. Give me 40 million, give me unlimited FBI, unlimited interviews. They interviewed 500 people. Listen to this, 2500 subpoenas, they did everything. The collusion, no collusion, they have no collusion. Then, I have an article, too, where I have the right to do whatever I want as president, but I don’t even talk about that because they did a report, and there was no obstruction. After looking at it, our great Attorney General read it. He’s a total professional. He said, “There’s nothing here. There’s no obstruction.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","48:35"
"Donald Trump","So, they referenced no obstruction. So, you have no collusion, no obstruction, and yet, it goes on. And they think this is helping them. I personally think it’s hurting them. A lot of people think it’s very bad for them, but it just goes on. I wrote something out this morning on a thing called Twitter, whether we like it or not. It is a good way of getting the word out because I saw Mueller’s testifying tomorrow again. How many times? Two-and-a-half years, and actually, it started practically from the time I came down on the escalator. They said, “He’s got good numbers. We better start looking at him right away. Maybe he’s dealing with a foreign country.” I’m saying, “What are you talking about?” Listen to this. I wrote this out this morning. I said on Twitter, “Well, let’s see. We have the best economy in history,” and it used to be it’s the economy’s stupid, right? It’s the economy, nothing else. It’s the economy’s stupid. So, we have the best economy in history, the best employment numbers in history, the most people working, almost 160 million, in the history of our country. The most people working, that’s a big number.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","50:11"
"Donald Trump","So, we have the best economy, the best unemployment numbers, most people working. On Thursday, we have the highest stock market in the history of our country, and a lot of you with 401(k)s, now, that’s not a rich people thing. The people that own that stock are people with 401(k)s, everything else. We have the best stock market in the history of our country. We just got the biggest tax and regulation cuts in the history of our country. We got rid of the individual mandate from Obamacare, which was the worst part of Obamacare. We got, perhaps, the biggest energy site in the world approved in Alaska called ANWR. Nobody could do it from Ronald Reagan to present, they said, “Can’t do it.” We got ANWR approved. We have the best and newest military that we’ve ever had, almost totally rebuilt from the depleted military that I inherited two-and-a-half years ago. Our military was totally depleted from these ridiculous, endless wars. So, we have the best, newest military in history, and the VA, you don’t hear any problems anymore, do you? Remember, you’d hear so many problems. We have the best VA in history, and I got choice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","51:28"
"Donald Trump","That’s one of the things that’s working so that if a person has to wait for three weeks, four weeks, five weeks, can you imagine you go to a doctor, they say come back in six weeks? People were coming back that were sick, and they were coming back, and they were terminal. They could’ve been saved. They were waiting so long. So, I’ve got choice. If you have to wait, you go out, you see a doctor, we pay the bill, okay? The least important things is we save money. That’s the least important thing in that case, but we do save money, but we also have a very happy VA. They love it. Those are just a few of the things. So, we have all of this, the best economy, best market, best military, best VA, best everything and much, much more. And then, I say in this statement this morning, “Gee, let’s impeach the president.” I mean, you figured. These people have gone totally crazy. They’ve gone totally crazy. It is sort of nuts. That’s true. I guess that was a Clinton statement, right? It’s the economy’s stupid. Is that Clinton? But it’s not everything about the economy. It’s not everything, a lot of other things, but we’re at the top of every single thing that we do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","52:56"
"Donald Trump","When you think our military, and you look at … And let me tell you something I didn’t put. We are respected as a country again. They respect us because other countries have been ripping us off so badly, and some of the worst offenders are our so-called allies. They rip us off on trade. European Union is worse to us on trade than China, okay? Nobody would think that. A lot of us come from European Union. We come from Europe, our grandparents, our great-grandparents. So, you think, “Oh, isn’t that nice?” Except they kill us, the European Union. It was formed in order to beat us economically, and yet, we protect them with NATO. So, they rip us off on trade, and we protect them with military, but here’s the problem with the protection. They’re not paying their bills. So, they United States, I’ve got a $100 billion more on the last two years, 100 billion. I got them to pay. I said, “You got to pay.” Nobody else has ever done that. It was like this with every other president. President Obama would go meet them. He talked nice, I don’t know, to me, not so nice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","54:12"
"Donald Trump","Some people would say, “Oh, isn’t that a wonderful speech?” I said, “No. I fell asleep during that speech. I fell asleep.” I don’t get it. I don’t get it. He never got crowds like we get. That, I can tell you. So, we’ve got to be doing something right, but think of this. So, they weren’t paying their bills. So, we’re paying for close to 100% of NATO. So, here’s the story. They rip us off on trade. They have trade barriers that make it impossible for certain groups like farmers and others to go in. They rip us in trade, and then, we protect them, and they rip us on that, too, and they don’t pay their bills. Other than that, it’s a wonderful deal. So, we’re getting it straightened out, folks. We’re getting it straightened out. Somebody said, “President Obama is much more popular in Germany than Donald Trump.” Well, he should be. He should be because Germany is the biggest offender. They don’t pay. They’re paying one percent. We’re paying 4.3% of a much bigger GDP. Germany doesn’t want to pay. They’re supposed to pay two percent. They’re paying one percent, and I say, “You got to pay, Angela. You’ve got to pay, Angela. Please pay, Angela.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","55:20"
"Donald Trump","And then, they say, “Who do you like better, Obama or President Trump?” Oh, I like President Obama. He was a [inaudible 00:56:40]. Look, if I start getting good poll numbers over there, I’m not doing my job, okay? That’s the way it is. That’s true. I’m not doing my job. But they still like me, and I have a good relationship and a great relationship with some, but somehow, even in this era of unprecedented prosperity and peace, the timeless traditions and values that make the American dream possible are under attack like no one has ever seen before. These people have lost all control, and even the Democrats, they’re left, but now, they’re getting dragged into a radical left position. I can’t imagine who’s doing that, but they’re being dragged radical left with these people that I believe, honestly, I believe they hate our country, okay? I believe they hate our country, and it’s true. When I watched this maniac Tlaib screaming and shouting, and this was before she was a Congress person.

By calling them out because we don’t like when they talk about evil Jews. We don’t like when they say horrible things about Israel. People are opposed to Israel, and they can express their opposition, but when they say it with venom, hatred, and language that nobody would use, nobody would use, it’s incredible, and then, you don’t have the Democrats fighting for Israel, and they end up passing things that have nothing to do with what the original problem was.

Who do you fight for? And we fight for all these countries, and it costs us a fortune, and some of the countries are really wealthy. By the way, I’ve gone to all of them saying they have to now pay for their military. Okay. If you don’t mind that, okay. They haven’t done it. I mean, we’re fighting for countries that are so wealthy, some have nothing but cash. Nobody ever asks them, “Why aren’t you paying us for this? Why aren’t you reimbursing us for the cost?” But we now ask those questions. On the Straits, so, we get very little oil from the Straits anymore. In fact, yesterday, it was very interesting. They said, “It’s very interesting. There are no USA tankers here.

And yet, we’re the ones that, for many, many decades, we’re the ones that policed it. We never got reimbursed. We police it for all these other countries, and I said a while ago, I said, “Why are we policing for China? Very rich. For Japan? Very rich.

They say they never shot down a drone, then they say about, “We have captured 17 Americans,” I said, “No, no, that’s …” First thing I did, I call up the CIA, “Sir, totally false.” Okay.

I’m talking about the radical left among us, I’m not talking about the radical left that are looking over failed countries like Venezuela and others, I’m talking about the radical left among us. They see our history as a source of shame, our traditions and our victories as relics to be replaced, our values as obstacles to be removed, our citizens as subjects to be controlled, and America as a menace to be constrained.

She was throwing that out about the presidency, and about the president, and such a sad thing to see how low have we gone. The far left has one fundamental objective, and that’s the objective of power.

The people that I’m looking, they said, “Who’s your toughest opponent?” I said, “So far, I dream about these people that I’m looking at.” There is no Winston Churchill in the midst, there is nobody that we look at. But you have to be very careful. Socialism is not as easy to beat as you think. When you’re wealthy, and you’re doing record stock, so you have 401ks, and you have all of the things that you have, and everybody’s doing well. Somebody comes along, says, “We’re going to give you free everything, everything’s going to be free.

"Donald Trump","“We’re going to do the Green New Deal,” which is the craziest thing I’ve ever heard. It’s crazy. But don’t kid yourself, not as easy when I’m up there on the debate all alone with some maniac that they chose. That maniac is saying. “We’re going to do this for you, we’re going to do that for you, we’re going to give you everything. We’re going to give you … Everybody gets a free Rolls-Royce. Every family. We’re going to take better care of illegal immigrants than we take care of our citizens,” they tell you. When they’re saying all of this stuff, and then those illegals get out and vote, because they vote anyway. Don’t kid yourself, those numbers that California and numerous other states, they’re rigged. You got people voting that shouldn’t be voting.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","01:08:22"

In many cases, they don’t even do that. You know what’s going on. It’s a rigged deal. For example, the radical left is waging an unprecedented assault on the rule of law in America. They are. They want to eliminate our borders and totally abolish ICE, and now they want to abolish a thing called Homeland Security.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-turning-point-usa-teen-student-summit-speech","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Turning Point USA Teen Student Summit Speech","01:09:16"
"Donald Trump","That means going on airplanes without any security, that means doing all of the things that you do, and you appreciate it, but you don’t even see what’s going on. But they now want to abolish Homeland … They started off with ICE. Let me tell you, these ICE people are great patriots. That’s a tough job. They go into these MS-13 gangs, and even your local law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. These gangs are mean, they’re tough. They deal in a medieval style. They cut people up medieval style, because it’s more painful. These are sick people. We don’t want them.

They’re so respected, and yet they don’t know it because all they do is they see the negativity put on by the media. The American people forcefully reject these hate filled attacks, and that’s what they do, the hate filled, and they are indeed attacks, on our very brave public servants.

There are no … They have gone … They used to call up and say, “We’d like to just verify this statement, or verify a quote.” They don’t even call up anymore. We don’t hear from The New York Times, which is totally crooked. We don’t hear from The New York Times, The Washington Post, which is the Amazon, I always say it’s the Amazon lobbyists.

It’s a lie. They don’t check, they don’t do anything. They’re really, really dishonest people. I’ll tell you, when I say the enemy of the people, when I say the fake news, when I say these things, I’m not kidding. It’s really dishonest. They have become, they like the word “unhinged,” they have become, the media has become totally unhinged. They used to call. When I was a … I used to get the greatest publicity. When I was doing buildings, I was happy, no problems. I was doing buildings, I didn’t have to worry about North Korea, Iran. I didn’t have to worry about China and trade.

I’ll say, “First Lady, I just got a good story. It’s time to hang it up. It’s time.” Some day we’re going to get them.

Our law enforcement, they leave them alone. Anybody that looks real tough and real nasty, they leave them alone. They only go after somebody that stands there and is not a fighter, nothing wrong with that, and they beat the hell out of them, and they pummel him like what happened two weeks ago. They pummel him.

"Donald Trump","Thank you. Because as patriots we cherish our first amendment, we believe that every American has the God given right to speak his or her mind, and no one can ever take away that right. For centuries, Americans freely exchanged their ideas in the public square. Now the public square exists online, and massive, multi-national tech companies have gained enormous power to sensor opinions, shape public perception, and really to decide what information citizens are going to be given. I see it all the time, I see it on social media for me. I have people coming up all the time, “We want to follow you sir, they make it so hard to follow you.” I have millions and millions of people, but it should be much more. I know exactly what’s happening. I know when it started. But the only thing I do say is this, it’s happened from the beginning. Facebook, Twitter, Google, all of them.

Everyone tells me when you read, they talk about this tremendous power, and I’m saying, “That’s right, they’re making it impossible.” Then somebody will look at me, “But sir, you won.” But they’re gaining more, and more, and more, and we’re looking at a lot of things, because they have not treated us as Republicans and conservatives. Even when you get into religion, they have not treated us fairly. They haven’t treated us fairly. A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of the people. That is why I’ve asked my administration to explore every possible regulatory and legislative solution, because you have to have free speech. You have to have free speech. I’ve also instructed federal agencies to hold our public colleges and universities accountable when they do numbers. You go up to speak, and what they do to our people is just … By the way, I’m President, of all the people, everybody. Everybody. I love everybody. I have people maybe I shouldn’t love.
