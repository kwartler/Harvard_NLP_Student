Get out there and vote. We’re going to have a bigger victory. And I don’t know if you found that you’ve been here a long time. I hope the music was good. I hope life is good. Everything’s good.

"President Trump","I don’t know if you know what’s happening, but they’re very worried, the Democrats about Florida. They’re very concerned. The vote’s not there. It’s not there for them. They had to get out to that big early lead and it could be that we’re leading, that’s a little problem. Two days from now, we’re going to win, my home state of Florida and we are going to win four more years in the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","01:19"

With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our great military, protect your Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase, Made in the USA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","01:59"
"President Trump","Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. You see what’s happening. You see it happening right before your eyes. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded in the history of our country. 33.1%. 33.1%. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months alone. Another record, record, record, we got many records. Now we have a chance to do something next year, even greater than last year, we had it the best ever and then we got hit by the plague from China and we will never forget. We’re never going to forget it. And then we’re building it up in a level that nobody thought possible leading every nation in the world by far. While foreign nations are in a free fall, we are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. Nothing and no one in the world is doing what we’re doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","02:28"
"President Trump","Now, if somebody wants to quadruple your taxes, I can’t tell you what’s going to happen. I think I can. It’s called the depression. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under sleepy Joe Biden and Obama. And if Biden and Kamala, Kamala, Kamala, most liberal member of Congress, she makes crazy Bernie look like he’s a very strict conservative, and the radical left gain power the economy will collapse and our country will go into a very deep and steep depression. I hate to tell you. Look, we’re not going to have to worry about it.

We’re looking great in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Iowa. Did you see the poll just came out in Iowa? First big poll? We’re only up eight. I’m very upset about that, we’re only up eight. We’re looking very strong, looking strong in Georgia. We just left the great state of Georgia. We’re looking strong in Georgia. In fact, they said, “Sir, you don’t have to go to Georgia.” They said a couple of days ago, I said, “Wait a minute, people are waiting for two and a half days. I’m not going to cancel on Georgia.” I’ve been doing this since early in the morning, only for you, I guess I could have canceled you too. Right? But nobody would have the courage to cancel you.

Because as I’ve said many times, this will never ever, ever be a socialist nation. Sleepy Joe Biden will raise your taxes $4 trillion. Can you believe it? He’s the only candidate I’ve ever seen that campaigns on the fact, “I will raise your taxes,” this guy. “I will take away your Second Amendment. We will not frack.” For two years, “We will not have frack,” then he got to Pennsylvania, he said, “Well, I was only kidding.” Look at all the press at this time. At this… Look at that them.

Sleepy Joe, it won’t be him because he has no idea where he is, but he’s surrounded by a lot of very far left people. Close down your factories, send you jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs.

Because if there’s trouble, we have somebody right over here that can handle it very nicely. I guarantee, I bet everything in this guy right here. You know the one that make all the noises are people, somebody shouts, they have no voice, they’re week. They have no voice. Their mother’s looking for them, their father’s looking for them.

As long as I’m here, nothing’s happening. They want to ban fracking, abolish energy, cut your Medicare, cut your social security by allowing millions of people to come into our country and indoctrinate your children with anti American lies.

In 2016, Florida voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. If I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. Probably why we won. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody in this place, except one person, perhaps him. He’s the only one that fights harder.

He came out like your opponents come out. No, that was not good for him. How about the last question? We talked about energy, right? “Well, I’d like to transition out of petroleum.” I felt like Perry Mason. The last question of the evening, I said, “Whoa, did you tell that to Texas? Did you tell that to Pennsylvania?” Even Kristen Welker, who frankly did not a bad job considering she’s totally on the other side of the plate, she looked and she said, “Why did you say that?” She trying to save the poor guy. “This is what we got.

We’d get more, but they don’t have any more room. How about this? You take an airport, right? You take an airport, you don’t have enough room. Did you ever think of that one? We have an airport. We don’t have enough room. This is amazing. There’s never been anything like this has ever happened in the history of politics. Probably on any other history and I don’t have a guitar. You know the truth is… No, it’s true. They don’t get crowds like this. Nobody gets crowds like this. You know what gets crowds like this? Making America Great Again. That’s what it does.

Barack Obama left me 142 federal judges. Nothing like that’s ever happened, nothing. Very rarely does it … You know, when you’re a president, every one … You leave; every one of them is filled. Those are the most important things you can have. Federal judgeships, lifetime appointments. It’s such a big deal. He left me 142, and we are going to have … Listen to this.

They tell you about people that are driving down a highway with an American flag and a Trump flag. Don’t worry; they’ll be just fine. They are going to be just fine. If they’re watching, I guess they were in Texas, right? Oh, Texas will be just fine. We’re doing great in Texas, by the way, really good. You know how? Is this the greatest?

I’d say zero. We actually gained. People heard about it. They said, “Let’s go.” No, it’s great to be with you. It’s great. Tomorrow, I have five more. Can you imagine five? Five.

You wouldn’t even believe them, the level of stupidity, the things that we saved. Like we saved a couple of billion dollars on the embassy in Israel. We built it for slightly less. We built it for slightly less. First, I picked the site that we already owned. You know, that’s better than paying millions for a site, but I picked one that was a better location, bigger, better. Then they were going to build the building for anywhere between one billion and two. This is like a two-storey building, right? One billion and 2 billion, and we built it for $500,000, a slight saving.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","27:20"

But when you’re building in Jerusalem, it’s a very cheap material. I said, “Use Jerusalem stone. It’s great stuff.” And we opened it for $500,000, instead of two billion dollars. That’s one of many.

I said, “This is not possible to read those things, going, “Wah.” You know, the winds were like 30 to 40. The press knows. They couldn’t hold onto the camera. That was a positive event. They know.

And some of them were very tough countries, but we were able to get them out. That’s a lot. That’s a record too. And what do we have?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","50:45"
"President Trump","Robert O’Brien, is he around here? He’s fantastic. Where’s Robert? Where is Robert? He is so good. What happened to him? He’s out negotiating a hostage deal. That’s all he does. Where is Robert? Where is Robert? Robert, look at him. I’ll tell you. He’s a little, he’s a little tired. This is his fifth rally today too. He’s fantastic. He’s fantastic. What a job he does. Thank you, Robert. Great job too. Congratulations. That was brave. I said, Robert, do you want to do it? It was like, yes before I finished the question. You want to do it, Robert? Yes. So anyway, good job. Thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","51:33"
"President Trump","The operation should serve as a stark warning to terrorists and thugs who try to kidnap our people. You cannot escape the long reach of our American military or American justice. You can’t do it. We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate and it was a mess. Let me tell you, when I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place. It’s gone, 100%. We killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for 14, first day in office, I said to our people, great people. I said, where’s al-Baghdadi? That’s all I heard about, al-Bag, every time I’d say where’s al-Baghdadi. And one day they came in, they said, we have him, sir, what do you want us to do? I said, I’ll tell you what, let’s go. And we got a bad, bad guy, founded ISIS. And he was trying to rebuild it again. We eliminated the mass murderer of us troops, and many troops and many people. Soleimani is dead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","52:21"
"President Trump","I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. Iran is not doing well. They had a 27% GDP decline. It was like the opposite with all the sanctions. I’ll tell you the first call I get, if we win, we got to win. First call I get will be from the Supreme Leader, as he calls himself, the Supreme Leader. I refuse to call him the Supreme Leader, but he calls himself the Supreme Leader. The first call will be from the Supreme Leader. And you know what? I’d love to make a deal with him. You know why? We don’t want to do anything bad, but we just can’t let them have a nuclear weapon, if that’s okay. Can’t let them have.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","53:29"
"President Trump","Obama paid him $150 billion, 150 billion, 150 million would be a lot, but 150 billion. It’s not even, it’s not even conceived. This is people that don’t have any clue about life. Gave him 1.8 billion in cash, in green. Can you believe it? Cash. Five plane loads, big planes. Exactly, where is that beautiful plane that we came in? Where the hell is it? Oops. Somebody stole Air Force One. Planes like that. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they’ve been negotiating. People would fly in, fly out, fly in, fly out, have dinner, have lunch, fly in, fly out. 52 years. I did it in two hours, a little bit less.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","54:10"
"President Trump","And instead of endless war, we are now forging peace in the Middle East. We have the countries aligned, [inaudible 00:07:18]. No blood in the sand, no costs, no nothing. They want, you know what? After all these years, frankly, we just said, what did Obama do? And I heard, and you know what I did? I did the opposite. I said, what did Obama do? And then I did the opposite, and it worked. Biden and Barack Hussein Obama made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro regime on Cuba. That was the other thing I did. I said, who made the deal? Obama. I said, we’re going to go the exact opposite way. Okay. We only have a 96% approval rating with Cuban Americans, 96. 96%. Who the hell are the 4%? Champ, who are the 4%?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","55:09"
"President Trump","Now the Biden campaign has said that they will work closely with socialistic dictator Maduro in Venezuela. Not the way you do it. My opponent embraces socialists and communists because he has no choice, because that’s who he’s dealing with in government. I stand with the proud people of Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, in their righteous struggle for freedom. And we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me is, we are making, by the way, we’re making a lot of progress. A vote for me in the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. That’s what it is. So in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, it’s already started. We will expand opportunity zones, increase vocational education, and provide school choice to every family in America. We will hire more police. Increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your second amendment. [inaudible 00:58:08]. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we’re doing. We will end surprise medical billing. Require price transparency, lower drug prices to the lowest levels they’ve ever gone. And we will always protect patients with pre existing condition. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars very soon. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","56:15"
"President Trump","For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great, incredible, wonderful people of Florida. You better vote, vote, vote, vote. Two days from now, America’s fate is in your hands. And as I said, we win Florida. We win it all. Your vote can defeat the Washington swamp. We’ve done a good job of it, but it’s deeper and more vicious than we ever thought. And the corrupt media right there, once and for all. So you must get out and vote.

"President Trump","Oh, good. Joan Miller from the Brooklyn Club. Hi, Joan. Joan, let me finish up. Joan, thank you very much. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Orlando to Jacksonville, and from Pensacola to Miami, we inherit the legacy of American Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-opa-locka-florida-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Opa-locka, Florida November 1","01:00:24"

We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America powerful again, our military.
