"Donald Trump","Okay. Thank you very much. We have a cabinet meeting? We’ll have a few questions after grace and if you would Ben, please do the honors.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","00:00"
"Ben","Our kind Father in Heaven, we’re so thankful for the many blessings that you have bestowed upon us in this country and we’re thankful for the people of courage who had been here before us, who have fought hard for the rights of our country. We thank you for President Donald Trump, who also exhibits great courage in face of constant criticism. We ask that you would give him strength to endure and the wisdom to lead and to recognize you as the sovereign of the universe with the solution to everything. And the people around the President, the Vice President, the cabinet, the advisors, give us all a understanding heart and a compassionate heart. Those are the things that will keep America great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","00:09"
"Ben","Help us all to recognize as a nation that separation of church and state means that the church does not dominate the state and it means the state does not dominate the church. It doesn’t mean that they cannot work together to promote godly principles of loving your fellow man, of caring about your neighbor, of developing your God given talents to the utmost so that you become valuable to the people around you, of having values and principles that govern your life. If we do those things, then we will always be successful. We thank you for hearing our prayer, in your Holy name. Amen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:12"
"Donald Trump","Thank you Ben, that was a great job, appreciate it. The economy is doing fantastically well. It’s getting very close to another record. We’ve had many records since we won office. We’re getting very close to another record. I don’t know if anybody saw the household median income for eight years of President Bush, it rose $400. For eight years of President Obama, it rose $ 975 and or two and a half years of President Trump, they have it down as two and a half years, it rose $5,000 not including $2,000 for taxes. So it rose, let’s say 7,000. So in two and a half years, we’re up 7,000 compared to 1,000, compared to 400 and that’s for eight years and eight years. That’s a number that just came out. But that’s a number that I don’t know how there could any dispute or any… I’ve never heard of a number like that. Meaning the economy is doing fantastically well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","02:00"
"Donald Trump","We need for our farmers, our manufacturers, for frankly, unions and non-unions, we need USMCA to be voted on. If it’s voted on, it’ll pass. It’s up to Nancy Pelosi to put it up. If she puts it up, it’s going to pass. It’s going to to be very bipartisan. It’s something that’s very much needed and will be hundreds of thousands of jobs. Mexico and Canada have approved it. It’s done. They are waiting for our approval and we can’t seem to get the votes. I call them the do nothing, Democrats. I mean that, they’ve done nothing, but this is something they can do very easily. We’ll give them bipartisan approvals and credits, all the credits they want, but they have to be able to do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","03:06"
"Donald Trump","So the economy is doing fantastically well. We want to vote on USMCA. We have other trade deals that we’ve done. We’ve done South Korea, which is a fantastic deal for us. It turned out even better than we thought. South Korea was a terrible deal. The person in charge of that particular deal, Hillary Clinton if you’ve heard of her? She’s the one that’s accusing everybody of being a Russian agent. Anybody that is opposed to her is a Russian agent. So that’s a scam that was pretty much put down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","03:50"
"Donald Trump","Tulsi, I don’t know Tulsi, but she’s not a Russian agent. I don’t know Jill Stein, I know she likes environment. I don’t think she likes Russians. If she does like them, I know she’s not a asset. She called her an asset of Russia. These people are sick, there’s something wrong with them. I think that Tulsi Gabbard probably got helped quite a bit by [inaudible 00:04:46]. I think we were helped, because it shows for two and a half years we end up winning. I had to go through two and a half years, if she would have done this earlier, people would’ve realized what a scam it is. Everybody’s a Russian or an Russian agent or an Russian asset.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","04:21"
"Donald Trump","The economy again is at a level that it’s never been. We are doing, whether it’s household income, whether it’s almost any chart, and I think maybe the best of all is unemployment. Unemployment has reached historic lows, African American, Asian American, Hispanic American reached numbers that nobody ever thought would be possible. Have the lowest ever in history.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","04:59"
"Donald Trump","So if you’re black, if you’re Hispanic, if you’re Asian, anybody, African American, Hispanic American, Asian, the lowest in history. For women, the lowest in 71 years, the best. When I say lowest, I’m talking about the best, both the best unemployment numbers and the best employment numbers. Either way you want to cut it, you can say them both, because it’s best in both. As far as employment is concerned, we have the most people working today than ever before in the history of our country. We’ve never had this close to 160 million people. So it’s some incredible things are happening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","05:26"
"Donald Trump","Syria, we will be giving a much fuller report, Mike Pompeo, Secretary of Defense, Esper and the different people that are very much involved, Mike Pence, Vice President. We’re having very good news coming out. The ceasefire’s holding, the Kurds are moving out to safer areas beyond the safe zone as we call it. Having the safe zone is not a bad thing. It’s a good thing and plenty of Turks have been killed because of conflict on their border. So you have to look at it both ways. But the ceasefire’s absolutely holding. There’s some skirmishes, but very little, relatively speaking. Of course, if you watched the fake news, it’s pretty wild. It’s really holding.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","06:06"
"Donald Trump","I’ve watched these pundits that had been working on this thing for 20 years. They’ve been working on the Middle East for 20 years. They don’t know what they’re doing and they’re telling me what to do. They say, “What did Trump get out of it? What did he get out of it?” I’ll tell you what I get out of it. We won’t be fighting and we’ll bring our soldiers back home. They were supposed to be there for 30 days and they’d been there now for 10 years, in Syria, 10 years. They’re supposed to go in, do a quick hit on ISIS and come out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","06:58"
"Donald Trump","Now as far as ISIS is concerned, when I took over November, 2016, ISIS was all over the place. I’m the one, meaning it was me and this administration working with others, including the Kurds that captured all of these people that you’re talking about right now. With President Obama it was a mess and I was told and you were told and everybody told it would be years before you ever did what I did in about a month and a half after I started. I went over to Iraq. I met with our generals and then we figured out a plan and it was done within a month and a half. So I’m the one that did the capturing. I’m the one that knows more about it than you people or the fake pundits. I have to smile to myself. I was telling a couple of people, “I’m watching these people that I’ve been watching for 20 years, I’ve been watching the same faces. They’re just a little bit older and a little bit grayer. I’ve been watching them for 20 years saying about the Middle East and they’ve been wrong on everything they’ve ever said.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","07:23"
"Donald Trump","Now all of a sudden he was starting to say, you know what Trump is doing is great and we have tremendous, tremendous power because since the election of 2016, November, since that beautiful day, our country’s picked up in value, trillions and trillions of dollars of worth, trillions and trillions of dollars. Numbers that nobody would believe, numbers if I would’ve said it on the campaign trail, I would’ve been excoriated by the fake media, excoriated. The numbers are far greater than anything that even I predicted. You hear that with the household median income? $400 for eight years, $975 for eight years. $7,000 for two and a half years up. Nobody’s ever seen numbers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","08:29"
"Donald Trump","Larry Kudlow is going to speak in a minute and he’s going to tell you that’s one of the greatest strengths of our country. By the way, other areas and countries are doing poorly. Europe is doing very poorly. Asia is doing very poorly. China is doing very poorly, worst year they’ve had in 57 years, I wonder why. I wonder why. I’m sure you can’t figure it out. We’re doing great. We’re taking in billions and billions of dollars in tariffs from China and they’re [inaudible 00:09:46] the tariffs because they devalued their currency and they’re pouring money into their economy because they don’t want to lose the jobs. But they are loosing the jobs, they’re having a terrible year, worst than 57 years they say. If they say that it means it’s worse and they announced that they have the worst numbers they’ve had in 20 years, they announced six, I don’t think it’s six. I think it’s probably minus something. Could very well be minus, could very well be in negative territory.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","09:19"
"Donald Trump","But we’re doing great. By the way, the deal with China is coming along very well. They want to make a deal because they have to make a deal, I think. they have to make a deal because their supply chain is going down the tubes, their supply chain is broken like you’ve never seen anything broken before. It’s broken. So our soldiers who are in Syria, they’re moving out very nicely. ISIS is being held by the Kurds and I have an absolute commitment from Turkey that they’re watching them just in case. So we have a double, we have the Kurds are watching them. As you know, most of the ISIS fighters that we captured, we, we, not Obama, we, we captured them. Me, our country captured them, working with others, including the Kurds and we helped them. Don’t forget, we helped the Kurds. Everyone said the Kurds helped us, that’s true. We help the Kurds. They’re no angels, but we helped the Kurds and we never gave the Kurds a commitment that we’d stay for the next 400 years to protect them. They’ve been fighting with the Turks for 300 years that people know of and nobody ever committed, “Gee, if you do this, we’re going to that, we’re going to stay with your forever.” Nobody every said that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","10:12"
"Donald Trump","But when I watch these fondants that that always are trying to take a shot. They say, “What are we getting out of it?” You know what we’re getting out of it, we’re bringing ourselves back home, that’s a big thing. It’s going to probably work, but if it doesn’t work, you’re going to have people fighting like they’ve been fighting for 300 years. It’s very simple. It’s really very simple, but we’re going to bring our soldiers back back home.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","11:26"
"Donald Trump","So far there hasn’t been one drop of blood shed during this whole period by an American soldier. Nobody was killed. Nobody cut their finger. It’s been nothing. They’re leaving rather, I think, not expeditiously, rather intelligently, just leaving, leaving certain areas, leaving. We’ve secured the oil. If you remember, I didn’t want to go into Iraq. I was a civilian so I had no power over it, but I always was speaking against going into Iraq. It was not a great decision, but I always say if you’re going in, keep the oil. Same thing here, keep the oil, we want to keep the oil. We’ll work something out with the Kurds so that they have some money, They have some cashflow. Maybe we get one of our big oil companies to go in and do it properly, but they’ll have some cashflow which they basically don’t have right now. Everybody’s fighting. It’s not a big oil area, but everybody’s fighting for whatever there is. So we have a lot of good things going over there and they’re going very well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","11:49"
"Donald Trump","As far as the continuation of the witch hunt, we beat the Russian deal. We beat the Muller deal. Now I find out, as I said before, that they’re trying to make other people into Russian agents, Russian assets, it has no credibility. Now they have what should be extremely easy to beat, because they have a perfect phone call. I made a perfect call, not a good call, perfect call. In fact, a friend of mine who’s a great lawyer said, “Did you know this would be the subject of all of this scrutiny? Because the way you expressed yourself, this is like a perfect call. You must have known this was going to happen.” No I didn’t. That’s just the way I talked to the President of Ukraine, who by the way said there was no pressure. There was no blackmail, there was no anything.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","12:51"
"Donald Trump","Congressman Hurd, I have to tell you yesterday, it was great, it was great, what he said, I gained a lot of respect for him very quickly because he said, “You know with all of this going on, I haven’t heard one Ukrainian say there was pressure. I haven’t heard one Ukrainian, not one, say that there was pressure of any kind. There haven’t even been reports of it to our people. Nobody’s even said it.” The reason you haven’t heard it, because there is no pressure,. The conversation I had was perfect. What happened is I released the conversation and that through shifty Schiff off. He’s a corrupt politician.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","13:34"
"Donald Trump","Schiff is a corrupt politician, that threw him off because he made up a lie. He made up what I said in my conversation and it went before the United States Congress and he said a made up story. It was fabricated. He totally fabricated it. They say he’s a screenwriter. Well, this was screen-writ. It was a fabricated story.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","14:10"
"Donald Trump","So he made up a lie and I released, they never thought that I’d do this. I released a transcription done by stenographers of the exact conversation I had and now the game was up. The other thing is the whistleblower and the other whistleblower and the informer, all these people, they seem to have disappeared. You know why they disappeared? Because they talked about another conversation, a conversation that I never had. They made up a conversation. Now if you look at the whistleblower report and you look at the actual transcribed conversation, the actual conversation that I had and you couple that with the President saying that that was a perfectly fine conversation. I don’t even know. He doesn’t even know what they’re doing. He didn’t even know about the money not being paid. Okay? I think that came out somewhere that the money… He didn’t know that. Then you also have his foreign minister saying, “No, it’s a very good conversation.” There was no anything asked there. There was no pressure whatsoever, so this is a phony investigation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","14:34"
"Donald Trump","I watched a couple of people on television today talking about it. They were talking about what a phony deal it is, what a phony investigation it is, and the Republicans have to get tougher and fight. We have some that are great fighters, but they have to get tougher and fight because the Democrats are trying to hurt the Republican party for the election, which is coming up, where we’re doing very well. Where I had a record crowd, the history of the arena it’s the biggest crowd they’ve ever had and we had 20,000 people outside at least.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","15:45"
"Donald Trump","We’re doing great in the election, you saw what happened in North Carolina. We picked up two seats that people didn’t think we were going to pick up, that was two weeks ago. Last week, a governor that people thought was okay, went down and now he’s got a big election. He was under 50%, nobody thought that was going to happen. We’re doing very well. But a lot of the stories that are made up between a guy like shifty Schiff who’s a phony guy, corrupt politician, the media buys it because unfortunately the media is corrupt also, much of the media, so much of it. Such a big percentage of it. It’s such a shame. Some great reporters, some great journalists, but some really bad people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","16:15"
"Donald Trump","So that’s the story. The economy’s good. We’re doing well with getting out finally after 10 years, again 30 days to 10 years and we’re getting out. Nobody, none of our people are injured. It’s very smooth thus far and I think that you’re going to see something that’s going to be good. Remember this, if Turkey misbehaves, I don’t think they will, but we have a power that nobody thought we had, to the extent, it’s called sanctions. It’s called tariffs. We’ll tariff the hell out of their product coming here. They send tremendous amounts of steel to the United States and other things. We will tariff them and we will sanction them, but I don’t want to use that as a threat, because Mike Pence and our Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, they went out and they negotiated a very good five day cease fire. I’m sure if we needed a little extension that would be happening. But our power is our power of economics, it’s a great power.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","16:56"
"Donald Trump","We’ve rebuilt the military since November of 2016. Our military was totally depleted from being in stupid situations like this for so many years. Our military was depleted to a level that we had very little ammunition, I was actually told we had no ammunition. Now we have more ammunition than we’ve ever had. Our military is as strong or stronger than it’s ever been. Probably stronger than ever. In a few short months as the equipment pours in from the money we’ve spent, two and a half trillion dollars, it will be in a level that it’s never even come close to. It’s a big difference. All made in the USA, all made in the USA. So we’re doing very well. If anybody has any questions, please feel free.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","17:57"

"Donald Trump","We don’t think it’s going to be necessary. I don’t want to leave troops there. It’s very dangerous there. We had 28 troops, as it turned out, people said 50, it was 28 and you had an army on both sides of those troops. Those troops would have been wiped out. I don’t think it’s necessary, other than that we secure the oil, it’s in a little different section, but we secured the oil.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","18:48"
"Donald Trump","The other region where we’ve been asked by Israel and Jordan to leave a small number of troops is a totally different section of Syria, near Jordan and close to Israel. That’s a totally different section. That’s a totally different mindset. So we have a small group there and we’ve secured the oil. Other than that, there’s no reason for it in our opinion. Again, the Kurds are going to be watching… we’re working with the Kurds, we have a good relationship with the Kurds, but we never agreed to protect the Kurds.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","19:10"
"Donald Trump","We fought with them for three and a half to four years. We never agreed to protect the Kurds for the rest of their lives. Remember this, when Iraq was fighting the Kurds, everybody thought we were going to fight with the Kurds. I said, well, it’s a little strange that we’re fighting with the Kurds when we just spent $4 trillion on Iraq and now we’re going to be fighting Iraq. So what I did is I said, we’re not going to take a position. Let them fight themselves. I thought the Kurds would do very well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","19:41"
"Donald Trump","Everyone said, oh, the Kurds will do very well. Well, Iraq moved in and the Kurds left. They didn’t fight because they didn’t have us to fight with. A lot of people are good when they fight them with us. When you have $10 millions worth of airplanes shooting 10 miles in front of your line, it’s much easier to fight.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","20:08"
"Donald Trump","But with that, they were a good help, but we were a great help to them too. They were fighting ISIS, they hated ISIS, so they were fighting ISIS but we never agreed… where’s an agreement that said we have to stay in the Middle East for the rest of humanity, for the rest of civilization to protect the Kurds. It never said that. We have protected them, we’ve taken very good care of them and I hope they’re going to watch over ISIS because that’s, again, most of it’s not in the safe zone as we call it. Some places call, demilitarized zone, in the old days would call areas like this, a demilitarized zone.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","20:27"
"Donald Trump","Our relationship with the Kurds is good and they’re going to be safe and I will say this, if shooting didn’t start for a couple of days, I don’t think the Kurds would have moved. I don’t think frankly you would have been able to make a very easy deal with Turkey. I think when it started for a few days, it was so nasty, that when we went to Turkey and when we went to the Kurds, they agreed to do things that they never would have done before the shooting started. If they didn’t go through two and a half days of hell, I don’t think they would’ve done it. I think you couldn’t have made a deal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","21:07"
"Donald Trump","People have been trying to make this deal for years, but we’re close to making it. We’ll see what happens. Again, they’ve been fighting for 300 years that we know of, 300 years. So why should we put our soldiers in the midst of two large groups, hundreds of thousands potentially of people that are fighting? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. Yes?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","21:42"

"Donald Trump","Well I think the Democrats fight dirty. I think the Democrats are lousy politicians with lousy policy. They want open borders. They don’t care about crime. They want sanctuary cities. They don’t care about drugs. They don’t care about almost anything. They don’t care about USMCA. How about that? I think they’re lousy politicians, but two things they have, they’re vicious and they stick together. They don’t have Mitt Romney in their midst. They don’t have people like that. They stick together. You never see them break off. You never see somebody go out and… that’s why I respected so much what I watched with Will Hurd today, because he was one of the few that didn’t seem to be there, and yet he made a statement.

"Donald Trump","This thing is all about a letter that was perfect. You never hear the letter anymore. It was all about whistleblowers. You never hear… what happened to the whistleblowers? They’re gone, because they’ve been discredited. What happened to the informant and where’s the IG? Why didn’t IG read the letter, read the transcript? He could have gotten that, I guess.

"Donald Trump","Why didn’t he read this and then see that the whistleblower’s account was totally different than the letter. Then he would have said, “Oh there’s no problem here.” The whistleblower gave a false account. Now you have to say, well, do we have to protect somebody that gave a false account? These whistleblowers, they have them like they’re angels. Okay? So do we have to protect somebody that gave a totally false account of my conversation? I don’t know. You tell me.

"Donald Trump","I don’t know. You tell me. Do we have to protect the informant? Now I happen to think that probably wasn’t an informant. You know the informant went to the whistleblower, the whistleblower had second and third hand information. You remember that. It was a big problem, but the information was wrong. So, was there actually informant, maybe the informant was Schiff. It could be shifty Schiff. In my opinion, it’s possibly Schiff. Why didn’t Schiff say that he and his staff or his staff or a whole group? Why didn’t he say that he met with the whistleblower. He knew all about the whistleblower. Why didn’t he say. He’s a crooked politician?

We’re better prepared than we’ve ever been. If Iran does something, there’ll be hit like they’ve never been hit before. I mean, we have things that we’re looking at, but can you imagine? I have to fight off these low lives, at the same time I’m negotiating these very important things. That should have been done during Obama and Bush and even before that. All right.

I got elected on bringing our soldiers back home. Now it’s not very popular within the beltway, because you know Lockheed doesn’t like it, and these great military companies don’t like it. It’s not very popular. And outside the beltway, my largest cheer in Dallas, I have 25,000 people close in that arena. A record crowd. I had so many people outside of the arena. Thousands. My largest cheer that night was two things, “We’re building the wall.” That’s number one, and number two and probably tied for number one was, “We’re bringing our soldiers back home.” That was our largest cheer in Dallas. Great place, great state, Texas, tough state. They’re tough. When I said we’re bringing our soldiers back home, the place went crazy.

It’s the most unpleasant thing I do. Most unpleasant than I do. I see that big cargo plane open and I see those coffins get rolled off.

It’s a lot of money. I would’ve given away. Like I give away my salary, I give away my salary. It’s I guess close to $450,000. I give it away. Nobody ever said he gives away a salary. Now it comes up because of this, but I give away my presidential salary. They say that no other president has done it. I’m surprised to be honest with you. They actually say that George Washington may have been the only other president who did, but see whether or not Obama gave up his salary.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","27:48"
"Donald Trump","See whether or not all of the other of your favorites give up their salary. The answer is no. They say it’s the only one. They think George Washington did, but that they say no other. So, I give up… It’s a lot of money for $450,000, close to, and I give that up. So, I have a place that’s in the best location. I’m very good at real estate. Very, very good. Very much better than you even understand. When you see my financials, which I’ll give it the right time. You’ll say, “Man, he does much better than we even thought.” This guy knows right here. Mnuchin, because he was in the private sector. He knows very much what I have. He would tell you. Someday, maybe he’ll tell you. But I’m very good at real estate.

Miami International, one of the biggest airports in the world. Some people say it’s the biggest, but one of the biggest airports in the world. It’s only minutes away, and it would’ve been great. But the Democrats went crazy. Even though I would’ve done it free. Saved the country, a lot of money. Then they say, “Oh, but you’ll get promotion.” Who cares? You don’t think I get enough promotion?

They run my, and I didn’t have to do that, but under no obligation to do it, you know, I don’t know if you know what, George Washington, he ran his business simultaneously while he was president.

That’s only, you know, a couple of examples, but other presidents, if you look, other presidents were wealthy. Not huge wealth. George Washington was actually considered a very, very rich man at the time. But they ran their businesses. George Washington, they say had two desks. He had a presidential desk and a business desk. I don’t think you people with this phony Emoluments Clause. And by the way, I would say that it’s cost me anywhere from 2 to $5 billion to be president. And that’s okay. Between what I lose, and what I could have made. I would have made a fortune if I just ran my business. I was doing it really well. I have a great business, and the best properties, but between when I was… And you know some properties, Doral’s an example. Doral we’re setting records when I bought it, because I owned it for a period of time.

I fully understood that. So, it’s cost me between 2 billion and $5 billion, and if I had it to do again, I do it in an instant, because who cares? If you can afford it what difference does it make? If I had this to do again, because I’m making a big difference for the country.

I don’t have bands. Right? So, that’s the story, and you know those people are the poll, and I’ve had great polls. I’ve had my best polls now. I think it’s because people think that it’s terrible what they’re doing. Pelosi, shifty Schiff, Schumer. These people are trying to destroy the country. It’s a very bad thing what they’re doing.

"Larry Kudlow","Thank you sir. I appreciate it very much. Here’s a point I want to make right at the start. You put out some great numbers on some of the recent releases. You know, first and foremost, this is a middle class boom. I can’t emphasize that enough. This is a middle class boom. Even though perhaps some people won’t give us credit for it. You’ve been rebuilding the economy, re incentivizing the economy, lower taxes, lower regulations, opening up the energy sector, tough trade reforms for level playing fields. So, after two and a half years, average real family income, 65,000 back… It’s really closer to $66,000. It’s a $6,000 gain to that. 8%’s better than anything our predecessors have done.

"Larry Kudlow","But it’s a long ways. You’re right. 65,000 almost 66,000 that is the middle of the middle. So, I think that’s very important. Than the increase of roughly 8% has never been done before. And actually if you look at the composition of wage increases, sir, the biggest gains have come in the middle quintile, the fourth and the fifth, the lowest 10% have had the biggest increases, not the highest wages, mind you, but the biggest gains. Which is what really matters to individual people. So, I think that’s absolutely a key point. The policies have spurred a middle class boom. Now three and a half percent unemployment, lowest in 51 years, 1.4% inflation. We’ve had a 50% increase on balance for the stock market. Household net worth, household net worth up $12 trillion. So, we’re about 103 trillion… $103 trillion for American household net worth. Disposable income is now growing at 3%. The reason these key points, inflation, stocks, income, wages, there’s a model.

"Larry Kudlow","They’re very interesting. I’m going to talk about the Moody’s model. It’s been run by a friend of mine. He’s an old friend of mine. Mark Zandi. Does not have much sympathetic views towards our administration or me for that matter, but nonetheless, nonetheless, he’s a good guy personally. I don’t take this stuff personally, but their model is now showing, because of stocks, inflation, what he calls the pocketbook model, which is the average family income you talked about before $66,000. His electoral range is 289 to 351. 289 to 351. I believe you need 270 to win, and the most important one is the pocketbook. The pocketbook model gives you 351,000. My former boss, Ronald Reagan used to go up take home pay. We’re seeing it once again. We’re seeing it once again. Is this stuff going to happen? Well, their view is, and Oxford economics said the same thing, “If we continue along this path, those are the kinds- ”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","42:45"

"Larry Kudlow","Those are the kinds of numbers that suggest a very substantial victory. A very substantial victory. Let me go on again, I’ll be brief on the wrap up here. America is working, as you said, “6 million jobs, 500,000 some odd manufacturing job increases since you took office.” Let me make this point. I’ve been working hard on this, trying to convince my former colleagues in the media, September payrolls. We’re still working. September payrolls including their visions. Up 181,000. Okay. 7.1 million job openings. 7.1 million job openings, 5.8 million unemployed. We have more job openings than we have unemployed. This is the 18th straight month. That is a very rare economic stat.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","43:56"

"Larry Kudlow","But let me go under the hood just for a second. Besides the payroll numbers, there’s another survey from which unemployment comes from. All right that 3.5% unemployment rate comes from something called the household survey, which tends to ask individual family members, small businesses, entrepreneurs, and startups. Okay. Household survey in the last four months is exploding, and it is averaging close to 400,000 per month. In other words, payrolls came in 180, and household survey is averaging close to 400,000. A lot of business and financial economists believe the household survey is your leading indicator. It tells me sir, we could be in for another takeoff on the jobs story. Wages, non-supervisory production wages up 3.5%. One more leading indicator, the housing market which has been soft for a over a year, we’re now seeing single family starts, and sales, and pending sales have now shown several months of steady increases. That’s a good leading indicator that the economy is going to be speeding up, not slowing down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","44:53"
"Larry Kudlow","All this in the face of couple years, of very tight monetary policy, and the fact that the rest of the world is not growing. Basically Europe’s been in recession. The rest of the world’s been in a virtual recession, because of our incentive minded policies. Because of our emphasis on trade, and energy, and deregulation. We are growing twice as fast as the rest of the world, and the numbers are telling me we may be ready for another pickup, we may be poised for another pickup after a quarter or two of softness. So, I think we’re in pretty good shape, sir. These are facts. My colleagues, or my former media colleagues may or may not agree, but I’m happy to go through the facts, which is what I’m really interested here. And of course it’s not breaking news that I’m a low tax rates supply sider from the Reagan lab for years, but I do want to bring in my friend, and colleague Russ Vought of OMB, because part of this is the regulatory story.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","46:20"

If we look at the economy wide cost savings, that $220 billion of savings for regulations, deregulatory initiatives in the pipeline. And that’s just the first round. Right now, we’re going through a process to figure out what’s next. We want to be finishing the big deregulatory initiatives this year that you ran on.

"Andrew Wheeler","Thank you, Mr. President. I’m here to update you on the implementation of your executive order regarding waters of the US. As you know, under the Clean Water Act, EPA regulates the discharge of pollutants of the nations navigable waters, also known as waters in the US, or WOTUS. In 2015, the Obama administration illegally expanded WOTUS to include things such as dry channels that only flows when it rains, isolated ponds, ditches. That meant that the vast majority of the nation’s waters would have fallen under the federal control.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","49:20"
"Andrew Wheeler","The Iowa Farm Bureau estimated that 97% of the state of Iowa would have fallen under federal control. North Dakota Agriculture Commissioner estimated over 90% of North Dakota would have been under federal control. The Obama EPA claimed that the rule was in the interest of water quality, but it was really about power, power in the hands of the federal government. The rule upset the federal, state partnership, and expanding WOTUS would have meant more land owners would have had to obtain costly federal permits for activities on private property.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","49:49"
"Andrew Wheeler","The permit process can cost anywhere from $30,000 to $300,000 for a water permit, and it takes one to two years, or more. The 2015 rule was mired in litigation. 31 states opposed it. Mr. President, you knew that the Obama WOTUS power grab was trouble from the get go, and when you took office you immediately asked us to fix the problem. EPA and the Department of Army are implementing your WOTUS executive order in a two step process.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","50:17"

The 2015 rule is no longer on the books, we revert back to the previous water definitions prior to 2015. We are working on finalizing step two, our new proposed WOTUS definition that we proposed last December. The proposal will clearly define what is a federal wetland, as well as what is not, which is just as important, and it will limit where federal regulations apply. Our overreaching goal is that a property owner should be able to stand on his or her property, and be able to tell for themselves whether or not they have a federal waterway, without having to hire outside consultants to do that for them. We received over 600,000 comments on our proposal, and we intend to finalize our proposal this winter.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","50:45"

They wanted $20 billion, and I got $40 to $50 billion, and they’ve already started buying. That’s just the way it goes. I want to thank China for that. And they have started the buying while we’re papering the deal, and that’s going well. We hope to sign it, probably in Chile when we have a summit in Chile, or wherever that may be.

We’re continuing to work on your scheme to bring drugs in from Canada, to import drugs, and how we can make sure we’re getting the same kind of deals for the American senior that other developed countries are getting, as you called it, most favored nation status.

We’ll give you the approval.” And we’re working on those final approvals now. Canada buy, because of arcane rules, and because of protecting the middle men, and protecting drug companies, frankly, other countries have prices that are much, much lower, more than 50% in some cases.

That just shows you how bad people have run our country. We’re going to get tremendous price cuts on drugs. We’re in the process, and I’d like you to speed that up, too, if you could. Really speed it up because Canada is loving to sell it. You can buy the exact same product for 50%.

You and Larry Kudlow mentioned some of those numbers, which really are virtually unprecedented, as you said, in some cases unprecedented unemployment numbers since we’ve been tracking for African Americans, for Hispanic Americans. The lowest unemployment rate for women in generations.

"Scalia","Americans who don’t have a high school degree have the lowest unemployment rate we’ve ever seen. And this has been, in part, because of your efforts to bring about deregulation, to free employers to grow, offer more jobs. I wanted to mention, too, that we’re doing at the labor department, and they’re both as a result of executive orders that you’ve issued, Mr. President. The first has to do with what we call association health plans. This is for small employers who employ tens of millions of American workers. They’re critical to our economy, but they find it hard to provide reasonably priced healthcare to their workers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:00:30"
"Scalia","What we did was we reduced some regulatory hurdles that stood in the way of small employers coming together, forming an association, working with the local chamber of commerce, for example, to provide healthcare through that association. That association can give the economies of scale of a larger company, it has leverage of a larger company, it has other ways that it can tailor the benefits available to these employees at the small employers.

But I’m also pleased to say that my favorite Attorney General, yours, my former boss, Bill Barr, his lawyers from the Justice Department are defending this litigation right now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:01:52"

"Scalia","We’ve got a related plan, what we call association retirement plans. This, again, is a result of an executive order you issued, Mr. President, same concept. Let smaller employers come together, achieve economies of scale, exercise leverage in negotiating to offer 401K plans. There are about 40 million Americans who don’t have a retirement plan, don’t have a 401K plan, this will make it easier for them to get those plans. Mr. President, those are two examples of steps that are helping the economy. They’re deregulating, but as I described, they’re helping workers get healthcare, get retirement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:02:12"

"Kellyanne","Yes. Thank you very much, Mr. President. Because of the focus that you and the First Lady, and the entire cabinet and administration have placed on combating the drug supply, drug demand crisis in our nation, we are happy to report the first decline in 30 years of overdose deaths due to drugs. A decline of 5.1% overall, falling off it’s peak in some of our states, up to 24%. A 24% reduction in overdose deaths in Ohio, 23% in Pennsylvania, and we’ve got about 19% in Iowa, 17% in Kentucky, 11% in New Hampshire, and 9% in the hardest hit state of West Virginia.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:02:54"

"Kellyanne","This battleship is turning in the right direction, albeit slowly. But Mr. President, the most significant bipartisan accomplishment, in my view, of your presidency was H.R.6. I’ve grown the year anniversary of HR6, every single Democrat voted for H.R.6, including the ones running for President. It is the largest investment at billions of dollars in prevention, education, treatment, and recovery, and surveillance to end addiction in our nation’s history on any one drug crisis.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:03:38"
"Kellyanne","Part of the education and equipping America is called Take Back Day. The Drug Enforcement Agency, the DEA runs two Take Back Days each year, the next one is this Saturday. Since the Trump administration got into office, we’ve collected 4.6 million pounds of unused prescription drugs. Let me repeat that, it’s not just 4.6 million drugs, that would be something. 4.6 million pounds. That’s the weight of 18 Boeing 757 aircraft, just collected. It is a drug supply and a drug demand crisis.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:04:02"
"Kellyanne","We have partnered with over 5000 law enforcement agencies, and due to private sector partnerships with CVS, Rite Aid, Google, Walgreens, Walmart, and the rest, we have 8300 total sites nationwide now that Google with map out for us. If you just type into the computer, “Take back my drugs, return prescription opioids,” they will show you locations in your area, tell you how to drive or walk there. It’s a safe way of returning your drugs. I think it’s a more convenient, and more compassionate way for people to return unused, unneeded, expired pills that happens on Saturday.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:04:34"
"Kellyanne","The cabinet has been so consistently and so deeply involved, I want to thank each and every one of them for this effort. Mr. President, as well as the First Lady and you. Also, I’m happy to report that CVS has fulfilled it’s commitment to double the number of take back sites, and in our effort to make every day take back day, people don’t need to wait any longer, or every six months. Walgreens, CVS, they’ve got safe delay… safe site safes where you’re delaying the distribution of pharmaceuticals to make sure it’s going to the person it’s intended to go.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:05:07"

And finally, Major League Baseball last week agreed to show DEA’s Take Back Day public service announcement this Friday during the World Series.

"Donald Trump","Thank you very much, Kellyanne. Take Back Day is a big deal. They’ve been talking about it for a long time, nobody’s every done it. But it is big. Alex wanted to mention just one additional thing?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:06:01"
"Alex","Yeah, just on the deregulation agenda. Deregulation is a key part of that great healthcare that you promised the American people, this vision of a personalized, affordable, patient centered system that puts you, the patient, in the center, and in control. Treats you like a human being, not like a number. If you’re focusing on the bureaucracy., that’s not focusing on the patient. We’ve delivered $12.5 billion of regulatory savings. That’s over half of the entire government.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:06:12"
"Alex","Give you an example, we have freed up 40 million hours of doctor and nurse time to not be doing paperwork. 40 million hours have been freed up that they can spend with patients instead. It’s just incredible change, and we’re going to be able to just keep delivering that level of deregulation each year.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:06:39"
"Donald Trump","Something that some people think could be as big or bigger than healthcare is transparency. We’re doing transparency. Do you want to give just a one minute update on that transparency, and pricing, and transparency on the quality of your dollar?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:06:57"
"Alex","Yeah, this is something. The President’s often said that transparency, and his initiatives on transparency could be bigger than any kind of healthcare… individual healthcare plan he might have. What he means by that is what we have proposed is making all of the hospital’s rates, what they have negotiated with the individual insurer, transparent and available so that you, the patient would know before you go to the hospital what something is going to cost you on your actual insurance plan. And we’ll do that with insurance regulations so that your insurance company will send you, before you go to the doctor’s office, an advance explanation of benefits.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:07:11"
"Alex","It tells you the list price, the negotiated price, and what you’ll pay out of pocket. We’re going to make this information available to you as individuals. This is going to empower you. This will shake up the entire healthcare system to put the patient at the center, so that you have the right to create a real consumer experience in healthcare, unlike what we’ve had for the last 50 years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:07:47"
"Donald Trump","And just to end as our trade deals start kicking in, these trade deals are incredible. Whether it’s North Korea, South Korea… North Korea’s going to be… probably something’s going to be happening with North Korea, too, there’s some really interesting information on North Korea. A lot of things are going on, and it’s going to be a major rebuild at a certain point. South Korea is getting much more involved with us than we ever thought in terms of the economy, and in terms of the trade deal. A lot of money is being spent over there, they’re going to be doing it through us. They’ve been doing tremendous purchases.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:08:06"
"Donald Trump","We had a tremendous deficit with them, and we’re slowly eating away at these deficits. We had deficits with everybody. But as the trade deals start kicking in with China, especially phase one with the farmers, and with the banks, the banking system, financial services. As they start kicking in you’re going to see a tremendous difference in the economy. The economy is already, by far, number one. If I weren’t elected, by right now China would be the largest economy in the world. It was expected, it was said by many people that China would right now. They were expecting around the second year of this term.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:08:44"
"Donald Trump","Not only aren’t they the biggest economy in the world, but they are way, way, way far away. We are much bigger than the China economy, and we’re getting bigger, and they’re not. Now, they have 1.4 billion people, I guess you’d call that an advantage. But we have an economy like no other. I think we have the strongest economy we’ve ever had. I think if you add the economy, the military, and all the other things that we’ve done, there’s nothing like it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:09:24"
"Donald Trump","But when trade deals start kicking in, and as I said, the South Korea deal did kick in, and things are happening with that that are very positive. But as they kick in you’re going to see tremendous numbers, tremendous changes because the trade deals we had were so pathetic. They were so bad I used to sit back and say to [inaudible 01:10:11] guys, “How did somebody actually negotiate these deals? How did they even negotiate them?” This was done at a level that it’s not even understandable why people were allowed to do it, why they were allowed, how did they get passed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-cabinet-meeting-transcript-trump-calls-emoluments-clause-of-the-constitution-phony","Donald Trump Cabinet Meeting Transcript: Trump Calls Emoluments Clause of the Constitution ""Phony""","01:09:54"
"Donald Trump","But we’re making great deals, and when they kick in the economy is good. As it’s been doing, I think, Larry, I can say that as good as it’s been doing, it’s going to be even better than that. Our country is doing fantastically well, perhaps better than every before.
