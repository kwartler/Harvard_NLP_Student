"President Donald J. Trump","Thank you very much. Wow. This is a very big crowd. Wow look at this. Hello North Carolina, hello. Two days from now we are going to win this great State just like we did last time. You were the one, right? You were the one that put us over that hump and we’re going to win four more years in the white house, our beautiful white house. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, protect our Second Amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are stamped with that beautiful phrase made in the USA. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. Under my leadership our economy grew at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1% just announced. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months while foreign nations are in a free fall, we’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse. A recent Gallup Poll just came out, found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago under Obama and sleepy Joe Biden.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","02:08"
"President Donald J. Trump","And I want to tell you it’s really windy up here. Thank goodness you have a President that doesn’t need teleprompters because these things are virtually useless. They are blowing all over the place. That’s true. They’re blowing all over. We started off today two great places. We went to Iowa, I’ll tell you what, in Iowa we had the coldest windiest, but it was warm because the people were warm and we’re going to win Iowa, very big, very big. But we had a couple of cold stops today. One was so cold we talked about refugees, we said, if they come in they’re going to say, “I want to go back immediately,” it was so cold. If Biden and Harris get in, the economy will collapse and our country will go into at least a free fall, but probably a depression, they want to raise your taxes. They want to take away your Second Amendment, they want to do lots of things that I don’t think you can stand for.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","03:53"
"President Donald J. Trump","I don’t think you can send for, fracking doesn’t pertain so much to it, it does pertain in a different way to you than it would to Pennsylvania. They’re taking away you’re fracking but what they’re really doing is your energy costs are going to go through the roof, that will be very bad for this incredible State. They want to massively increase regulations, send your jobs overseas, destroy the suburbs, well we’re keeping the suburbs. I got rid of the regulation that would have destroyed the suburbs, they will bring it back worse than ever before. Terminate religious liberty, eliminate school choice, outlaw private healthcare, and shred your Second Amendment, take away your guns and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. Biden has vowed to abolish U.S. oil, U.S. fracking, natural gas, industry. Look at what he’s talking about doing, but it’s not him, he’s shot, okay? It’s not him.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","05:02"
"President Donald J. Trump","It’s the radical left, it’s the radical left. Energy prices will explode and that will cripple our country. We, right now, are energy independent, what we have going we’ve never had before. Biden’s energy ban will send every state from North Carolina to Michigan to Pennsylvania into a very, very severe problem and we’re not going to have it, we worked too hard. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country and then the plague came in from China, it came in from China, they should have never allowed it. They stopped it from going into China, but it came to us and Europe and the rest of the world and we’re never going to ever forget, we will never forget. But now we’re building our economy back up and it’s going in a V, but it’s really a super V. As long as I’m President, we will remain the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the planet earth and we will remain energy independent. Our opponents’ agenda is a war on workers, a war on faith and a war on our great police. Biden says he’s running as a proud Democrat, I’m running as a proud American.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","06:09"

"President Donald J. Trump","Thank you. Thank you very much. By the way, I just have to say this. So we had something incredible happen four years ago. This is more important and there’s more energy, the crowds are bigger, everything’s hotter. But this is actually and I never thought I’d say it because that was an incredible period of time, never thought, this is the most important election perhaps in the history of my country. Get out and vote. Got to get out and vote. Sleepy Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in ridiculous, endless wars and they’re all coming back, they’re all coming back. North Carolina lost nearly half of its manufacturing jobs thanks to NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever. And we got rid of it, nobody thought that was possible. Promises made, promises kept. We did it all. Biden and his group shipped your jobs and your factories to China and other places in far away lands raking in millions of dollars for himself it turns out, we didn’t know about this, did we? His son was like a human vacuum cleaner, he went in and “Where are you going today, dad?” “I think I’ll go to Ukraine.” “Okay, let me pick up a couple of bucks.” $183,000 a month and $3 million upfront. “Where are you going today dad?” “I’m going to go to Russia,” “Good.” So the Mayor of Moscow’s wife gave him three and a half million dollars, right? And here’s the scary part, the fake news media and there’s a lot of it right back there, the fake news, they don’t want to talk about it, they don’t want to talk about it. And big tech will refuse to put it on and then they’ll terminate the New York Post if they put it up, New York Post I have to give them a lot of credit. Number one, they endorse me, which is nice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","07:48"
"President Donald J. Trump","I got endorsed today by the Pittsburgh Gazette and it hasn’t happened where they endorsed a Republican today. Nobody can believe it, they haven’t done it in decades. And thank you very much Pittsburgh Gazette, we’ll take it. We got endorsed by a lot of great people, we got endorsed by great people and a lot of newspapers are endorsing us because they know that Joe Biden is not up to this job. All you have to do is watch him for about five minutes, he is not up to this job. One thing I can tell you, President Xi, Putin, Kim Jong-un, they’re very sharp, they’re very sharp, they’re all very sharp and we cannot have a leader that’s not sharp. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who is bought and paid for by China and other countries.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","10:06"
"President Donald J. Trump","How can you have a guy whose son walks out with a billion and a half dollars to manage, that means millions of dollars a year, whose son asked for $10 million a year for introductory purposes, right? $10 million a year and he’s supposed to be negotiating with China? China would just hope that I don’t win because, hey, we’ve taken in tens of billions of dollars a year first time ever with China, we never took in $25 cents. Saved our steel mills, saved our steel mills, saved our steel and aluminum industries. In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt political establishment and you elected a President who is finally putting America first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because thankfully I’m not a politician and never will be. And if I don’t always play by …","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","10:57"
"President Donald J. Trump","Never will be. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because I fight for you and there’s never been anybody that’s fought harder for you. I had a very nice life before doing this. I had a very nice life.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","12:03"

"President Donald J. Trump","Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. So nice of you. That’s such a great honor, when I hear that. It’s never been said at any… I said, “Did anybody ever hear that? Ronald Reagan we liked, others we like.” Nobody’s ever heard it, and I appreciate it very much. My opponent is promising a long dark winter. Did anybody see the debate? I’m sure nobody watched it, right? He didn’t do too well. Remember he said, “You’re going to have a long dark winter”? It’s so inspiring. How about somebody says, “Gee, we really like Biden”? I don’t think anybody likes Biden. “Harry, let’s watch Biden tonight on television.” And he says, “We’re going to have a long dark winter.” How inspiring that is, right? So he said that, and I’m saying that we’re going to deliver the greatest American comeback in history. That’s what we’re doing, and we’re way ahead of schedule.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","12:33"
"President Donald J. Trump","This election is a choice between a Biden depression and a boom like you’ve never seen before. It’s a choice between a Biden lockdown. He wants to lock you down. Let’s lock it down. Let’s lock it down. And by the way, tell your Governor to open up North Carolina. It’s time. It’s ridiculous. It’s ridiculous. They’ll probably announce it on November 4th. “We’re going to open up now.” They thought our numbers wouldn’t be so good. They thought by keeping these states like Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan, how about her? Her husband roams free. He’s the only one in the whole state. No, but they thought that by keeping them down the numbers would … And yet we had, at 33.1, that’s the highest in the history of our country. By double. You have to go back to 1952, and that was half of what we did. So we are looking forward. We’re going to have very shortly, within a couple of weeks, we’re going to have a safe vaccine that will end.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","13:32"
"President Donald J. Trump","And now look, we’re rounding, they hate when I say it, the fake news, but we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner anyway. We’re rounding the corner. But on top of that, we have vaccines coming from Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, Moderna, great companies, and they’re right there, they’re right. And we’re going to have them launched. And our military is going to do it logistically. Incredible. And we’re going to start with our seniors, especially our seniors where they have some problems with heart, with diabetes, and we’re going to have a great thing. It’s going to speed up the process we launched. And by the way, it does work here. I am. Here I am. No, I like to say that the medicine I took, Regeneron, I’d like to say that it had no impact on me, because I’m a perfect physical specimen and I’ very young. But I decided to take it anyway.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","14:42"
"President Donald J. Trump","No, it’s amazing the things we’ve been able to do in the last six months. Not only that, if you look at all of what we produce now, we’ve become a production … Incredible what we’re doing and what we’re sending to the world. The ventilators, what we’re sending to the world, I mean, we’re sending things that nobody could believe. The treatments that reduce the fatality rate now 85%. Think of it, think of it. But my wife, our First Lady got it and our son Baron got it. And Barron’s 14, and he’s very tall and he’s strong. And he had it for a matter of minutes. That’s why I say, “Get the kids back to school. Get them back to school.” The doctor came up to us and said, “I’m sorry, but Barron has tested positive.” And I said, “For what? Tested positive for what? And it’s got about 30 different names, but he said, “COVID.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","15:40"
"President Donald J. Trump","We could call it the China Plague, the China Virus, but he didn’t say. He said, “COVID. I said, “Gee, that’s too bad.” He said, “Oh, he’ll be fine.” About 14 minutes later, he came back. I said, “How’s Baron doing?” “Oh, he shook it off. It’s fine. He’s fine.” They’re young. They have strong immune systems. Get them back to school, please. We’ve learned about this horrible plague that was sent to us by China. Our excess mortality rate in America is 40% lower than Europe. You keep hearing Europe is doing so well. They’re not doing so well. And we want them to do well, by the way. And we helped them. We helped them. We want them to do well. But they’re having a very hard time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","16:41"
"President Donald J. Trump","Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state while letting rioters roam fee. They close your churches, they close your schools, but if you want to riot and burn down the stores and have the anarchists out there and do lots of it, that’s okay. You can’t stop that. You can’t go to school and you can’t go to church. It’s crazy. All Democrat run, by the way. All Democrat run. You look at Portland, Democrat, super liberal Democrat. We could fix that situation. We have to be invited in. We fixed Seattle because we said, “That’s enough. We’re going in. We don’t care. We’re going in.” So we were going in the next morning. That night they found out about it. They said, “We’re leaving now. Thank you very much.” And we did a great job in Minnesota, Minneapolis. After you watched that place burning, down a week and a half later, they went in and solved it in about a half an hour.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","17:27"
"President Donald J. Trump","If we’d listened to Joe Biden on allowing travel to come in from China and Europe, remember he said, “Oh, he’s xenophobic.” Now, he runs for President, he said, “We should have acted sooner.” Months later, he didn’t think we should do it. Hundreds of thousands more people would have died. We saved two million people or more. Remember the model? It said 2.2 million people would die. Well, we saved two million people by acting quickly. Now, Biden wants a cruel and very heartless nationwide shut down. It won’t affect you, because you’re already shut down. I don’t know what the heck. What’s going on with your state? Are you ready to open up? I think so, huh? No, you know what? People aren’t going to take it anymore. Look at what happened in Europe, and the people are revolting. They don’t want to do it anymore. They can’t do it anymore. We can’t have the cure be worse than the problem itself. That was the first thing I said a long time ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","18:29"
"President Donald J. Trump","The Biden lockdown will result in countless deaths and wipe out an entire generation of dreams. And we’ve learned that children with a computer do not do well compared to being in classes. They don’t do well. It’s not the same. And the parents have to go to work, and the problems that are caused with alcohol, drug abuse. We can’t let this happen. And you can’t let it go on. I have a feeling that probably they’ll say, “It’s now November 4th, the day after the election, we’ll go back. We’ll go back.” He should have never done that. And they should have never done that. And actually, the states that are doing best, look at Florida, look at all of these states where they had a spike and they didn’t close down. Look at what happened in Arizona. Look at what happened in Texas. We can’t let it happen. Europe imposed Draconian lockdowns, and yet their cases are exploding. Their deaths are surging and their economies are, let’s face it, you look at what happened, they’re in ruins.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-hickory-north-carolina-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Hickory, North Carolina November 1","19:34"
"President Donald J. Trump","We had the smallest down and the largest up and the largest fast up on the economy, by far. So the European lockdowns are leading to more suffering, delayed medical care, and financial devastation. A vote for Biden is a vote for lockdowns, layoffs, misery, and getting rid of your Second Amendment. They want to hurt our police, but they want to take away your guns. Very interesting, isn’t it? If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then go cast your ballot, cast your vote for me. We’re going to do it. We’re doing it. But you don’t have to take my word for it, because in certain states that I like a lot, we spend a lot of money for, where is that rail? Look at that over there.

"President Donald J. Trump","After years of rebuilding foreign countries, we are finally rebuilding our country. For 47 years, the Democrats viciously and brutally repeatedly attacked. And you know what we’re talking about because it was led by a man named Joe Biden… Black Americans, they attacked. Decimated the black middle class and called young black men super predators. To every black American, I am asking for you to vote. You have to vote on Tuesday. You can send a message on Tuesday to the corrupt Democrat establishment. Thank you. Thank you.

They had no funding. They had… Every year, they had to come back and ask for funding. I said, “Nope, we’ve got to get your long-term funding.” We got them more money than they wanted.

I believe our country should be a sanctuary for law abiding American citizens. The Biden/Harris plan would also increase refugees 700%, opening flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism.

On her way to work one morning down the path, along the Lake, a tender hearted woman, saw a poor half frozen snake. His pretty colored skin had been all frosted with the dew. “Poor thing,” she cried. “I’ll take you in and I’ll take care of you.” “Take me in oh, tender woman. Take me in for heaven’s sake.

Take me in, oh, tender woman,” sighed that vicious snake. “I saved you,” cried the woman, “And you bit me, but why?
