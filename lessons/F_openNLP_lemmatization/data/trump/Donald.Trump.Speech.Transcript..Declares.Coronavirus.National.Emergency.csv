"Donald Trump","To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a National Emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to 50 billion dollars of very important and a large amount of money for states and territories and localities in our shared fight against this disease.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","00:00"
"Donald Trump","In furtherance of the order, I’m urging every state to set up emergency operation centers effective immediately. You’re going to be hearing from some of the largest companies and greatest retailers and medical companies in the world. They’re standing right behind me and the side of me. I’m also asking every hospital in this country to activate its emergency preparedness plan so that they can meet the needs of Americans everywhere. The hospitals are very engaged. New York and various other places are also various engaged. I just spoke with governor Cuomo. We had a very good conversation and we’re working very strongly with the many states including New York.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","00:28"
"Donald Trump","The urgency orders I’m issuing today will also confer broad new authority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Secretary of HHS will be able to immediately wave revisions of applicable laws and regulations to give doctors, hospital all hospitals and healthcare providers, maximum flexibility to respond to the virus and care for patients. This includes the following critical authorities, the ability to waive laws to enable telehealth, a fairly new and incredible thing that’s happened in the not so distant past. I tell you what they’ve done with telehealth has incredible. It gives remote doctors visits and hospital check-ins the power to waive certain federal license requirements so that doctors from other states can provide services in states with the greatest need.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:11"
"Donald Trump","Number two, the ability to waive requirements that critical access hospitals limit the number of beds to 25 and the length of stay to 96 hours. The ability to waive the requirements of a three day hospital stay prior to admission to a nursing home; big thing. The authority to waive rules to hinder hospital’s ability to bring additional physicians on board or obtain needed office space. They can do as they want. They can do what they have to do. They know what they have to do. Now they don’t have any problem getting it done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","02:12"
"Donald Trump","The authority to waive rules that severely restrict where hospitals can care for patients within the hospital itself. Ensuring that the emergency capacity can be quickly established. We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to. No resource will be spared. Nothing whatsoever. 10 days ago, I brought together the CEOs of commercial labs at the White House and directed them to immediately begin working on the solution to dramatically increase the availability of tests.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","02:51"
"Donald Trump","Other countries have called us and worked with us and they’re doing similar things or will be doing similar things as a result of that action. Today we are announcing a new partnership with private sector to vastly increase and accelerate our capacity to test for the Coronavirus. We want to make sure that those who need a test can get a test very safely, quickly and conveniently but we don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it and we don’t want everyone running out and taking; only if you have certain symptoms.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","03:30"
"Donald Trump","Using federal emergency authorities, the FDA approved a new test for the virus. We did this within hours after receiving the application from Roche, a process that would normally take weeks. We therefore expect up to a half a million additional tests will be available early next week. We’ll be announcing locations probably on Sunday night. I want to thank Roche, great company for their incredible work. I’d also like to thank Thermo Fisher. The FDA’s goal is to hopefully authorize your application within 24 hours. It’ll go very quickly. It’s going very quickly. Which will bring additionally 1.4 million tests on board next week and five million within a month. I doubt we’ll need anywhere near that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","00:00"
"Donald Trump","At the same time, we’ve been in discussions with pharmacies and retailers to make drive-through tests available in the critical locations identified by public health professionals. The goal is for individuals to be able to drive up and be swabbed without having to leave your car. I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. And we have many, many locations behind us, by the way. We cover this country and large parts of the world, by the way. We’re not going to be talking about the world right now. But we cover very, very strongly our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","00:47"
"Donald Trump","Stores in virtually every location. Google has 1,700 engineers working on this right now. They’ve made tremendous progress. Our overriding goal is to stop the spread of the virus and to help all Americans who have been impacted by this. Again, we don’t want everybody taking this test. It’s totally unnecessary. And this will pass. This will pass through and we’re going to be even stronger for it. We’ve learned a lot, a tremendous amount has been learned. I want to thank Deborah Birx and I want to ask her maybe to come up and say a few words as to what’s happening. Dr. Birx is a highly respected person. I’ve gotten to know her very well over the last six days and what we’ve done is we built something that was very old, very old fashioned, somewhat obsolete, certainly obsolete when it comes to the kind of numbers that we’re talking about. Dr. Birx, please. Thank you, Deborah.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:39"
"Deborah Birx","Thank you, Mr. President. It’s a pleasure to be here with all of you. I think you know at the beginning of this epidemic, HHS through CDC proactively developed an assay, built on the existing flu surveillance system. That surveillance system was then converted to diagnostic system. But last Tuesday, seeing the spread of the virus around the globe, the President realized that our current approach to testing was inadequate to meet the needs of the American public. He asked for an entire overhaul of the testing approach. He immediately called the private sector laboratories to the White House, as noted, and charged them with developing a high throughput quality platform that can meet the needs of the American public.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","02:47"
"Deborah Birx","We are grateful to LabCorp and Quest for taking up the charge immediately after the meeting and within 72 hours, bringing additional testing access, particularly to the outbreak areas of Washington State and California and now across the country. We are also very grateful to the universities and large hospital systems that took up the charge to develop their own quality tests made available by new FDA guidance. This has resolved and expanded testing across New York, California, Washington, Colorado, and you see sometimes those drive-through options that have been made available through these high throughput options.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","03:33"
"Deborah Birx","Following the meeting last week, major commercial laboratory equipment and diagnostic companies took immediate action to adopt and develop new testing systems. Last night, the initial company, Roche, received FDA approval, moving from request, to development, to approval in record time. This innovative approach centered fully on unleashing the power of the private sector, focusing on providing convenient testing to hundreds of thousands of Americans within short turnaround times. In less than two weeks together, we have developed a solution that we believe will meet the future testing needs of Americans. I understand how difficult this has been. I was part of the HIV/AIDS response in the 80s.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","04:10"
"Deborah Birx","We knew from first finding cases in 1981, it took us to almost 1985 to have a test. It took us another 11 years to have effective therapy. It is because of the lessons learned from that, that we were able to mobilize and bring those individuals that were key to the HIV response to this response. I understand that a lot of this behind the scenes action over the last couple of weeks was invisible to the press and the American people, but this intense effort has not only resulted in innovative solutions, but an automated high throughput system bringing the availability of these quality corona-viral testing to the American people at unprecedented speed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","04:56"
"Deborah Birx","Finally, I want you to know in South Korea, they did have a large number of tests available over the last several weeks. Their positivity rate is between three and 4%. With LabCorp and Quest expanded testing, their positivity rate is between one and 2%. So we want to also announce this new approach to testing, which we’ll start in this screening website up here facilitated by Google, where clients and patients and people of interest can go, fill out a screening questionnaire, move down for symptoms or risk factors. Yes, they would move down this and be told where the drive-through options would be for them to receive this test. The labs will then move to the high throughput automated machines to be able to provide results in 24 to 36 hours. That is the intent of this approach. We have seen it work just in our own United States and we want to bring this across the continent. Thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","05:43"
"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. [inaudible 00:06:49]. I’d like to maybe have, Tony, do you want to come up? You’ve become a … I think everybody out here knows you pretty well, but Tony has been doing a tremendous job working long, long hours and you’ve seen a lot happen, but this has been … It’s been a great experience and working with you has been terrific.

"Tony Fauci","Thank you very much, Mr. President. This is an example of another example of what I’ve been referring to in my discussions with many of you in the audience as a proactive leaning forward, aggressive, trying to stay ahead of the curve. And what you’ve seen now with this order is that we’re going to be able to remove the constraints so that people at the state, the local level, the individual physician, all the way up through the federal government will have as many constraints as possible, removed for them to do everything they possibly can so that we can implement the things that we’ve been talking about.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","07:13"
"Tony Fauci","The containment, the mitigation, so that as I’ve said, many times, that curve that I refer to that goes up. We don’t want to have that curve. We want to suppress it down to that small mound and I think what we’ve done today is something that is going to be a very important element in having us be successful in doing that. We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases, but we’ll take care of that. And ultimately, as the President said, this will end, but what’s going on here today is going to help it to end sooner than it would have. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","07:52"
"Donald Trump","Thank you very much, Tony. If I could, some of these folks, we know they’re celebrities in their own right. They’re the biggest business people, the greatest retailers anywhere in the world, and one of them is Doug McMillon from Walmart and I’d like to have Doug, if you would say a few words wherever you may be.

"Doug McMillon","When we got the call yesterday from the White House, we were eager to do our part to help serve the country. And given what we’re facing, that’s certainly important to do. We should all be doing that. So we’ve been asked to make portions of our parking lot available in select locations in the beginning and scaling over time as supply increases so that people can experience the drive-through experience that the President described. We’ll stay involved and do everything we can from a supply chain point of view to be of assistance. Thank you, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","08:48"

"Richard Ashworth","Yep. Thank you, Mr. President. And similar to Doug and Walmart, we’re happy to stand in here and help in communities all across America, because a lot of times when we have natural disasters, our stores are a beacon in the community and this situation is no different.

As the President mentioned, we now have capabilities from Roche Diagnostics that we will bring into our facilities this weekend.

"Mike Pence","Thank you, Mr. President. This day should be an inspiration to every American, because thanks to your leadership from early on, not only are we bringing a whole of government approach to confronting the coronavirus, we’re bringing an all of America approach. Mr. President, from early on you took decisive action. You suspended all travel from China, you created travel advisories to South Korea and Italy. We screened all travelers from all airports in both of those countries. And on the unanimous recommendation of your health experts, you at midnight tonight will effectively suspend all travel from Europe and Americans that were returning will be screened and asked to voluntarily participate in a 14-day quarantine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","16:23"
"Mike Pence","Throughout this process, Mr. President, you’ve put the health of America first, but you brought the best of America to address it. And it’s not just at the federal level. As you said, Mr. President, we’ve been working with states across the country. We issued broad guidelines from the CDC for every American. But this week at your direction, we tailored specific recommendations from CDC for New York, Washington State, California, Massachusetts and Florida. And we’ve been in continuous contact, as you said, with governors around the country. Mr. President, you have forged a seamless partnership with every state and every territory in this country to put the health of our nation first.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","17:17"
"Mike Pence","But today, I trust that people around the country that are looking on at this extraordinary public and private partnership to address the issue of testing with particular inspiration. After you tapped me to lead the White House Corona Taskforce, Mr. President, you said this is all hands on deck and you directed us to immediately reach out to the American business sector, commercial labs to meet what we knew then would be the need for testing across the spectrum. And today, with this historic public- private partnership, we have laid the foundation to meet that need. For Americans looking on, by this Sunday evening, we’ll be able to give specific guidance on when the website will be available.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","17:59"
"Mike Pence","You can go to the website, as the President said. You’ll type in your symptoms and be given direction whether or not a test is indicated. And then at the same website you’ll be directed to one of these incredible companies that are going to give a little bit of their parking lot so that people can come by and do a drive by test. Mr. President, I want to join you in thanking Walmart, and CVS, and Target, and Walgreen. These are companies that are synonymous with communities, large and small, where people come together and now they’re going to come together to meet the needs of the American public. These commercial laboratories, LabCorp, and Quest, and Roche have just done an incredible job stepping forward and they’re going to literally make, literally make hundreds and thousands of tests available and being processed with results to patients in the very near future.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","18:42"
"Mike Pence","But it’s all a result of you tasking us with bringing together not just government resources, which all state labs can now test across the country. CDC is testing. But you said, Mr. President, that we wanted to bring all the resources of the country together and that’s what this partnership really means. Truth is that we have coronavirus cases now in 46 American states and while the risk of serious illness of the coronavirus remains low, we want to encourage every American to practice common sense, practice good hygiene, go to the CDC’s website to see what the guidance is for your community, or for the American people broadly. And as the President has said, it’s especially important now that we look after senior citizens with chronic underlying health conditions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","19:33"
"Mike Pence","Last week the President directed the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services to raise the standards in our nursing homes, increase inspections at our nursing homes. And today, we’re offering very specific guidance, which Seema Verma will articulate about visitations at nursing homes. It’s important to remember that they were there for us when we were growing up, Mr. President. They helped us with our homework. They tucked us in at night, they cheered us on as we pursued educations, cheered us on in our careers. Now it’s time for us to be there for them and to recognize that seniors with chronic health conditions are the most vulnerable and Americans can make a difference. So wash your hands. Use common sense. Look after the most vulnerable. And Mr. President, I know I join you in saying that every American should be proud of this incredible public private partnership that’s going to be speeding access of testing to millions of Americans in the weeks ahead. And together, as you’ve said many times, together we’ll get through this, together we’ll put the health of America first.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","20:22"

"Seema Verma","Thank you. Well, thank you to the President for the declaration. It allows my agency, CMS, that runs Medicare and Medicaid and has oversight of all of the nation’s healthcare facilities to suspend regulations that could get in the way of treating patients during this time. These temporary national blanket waivers are reserved for the rarest of circumstances and they represent a massive mobilization of our country’s resources to combat this terrible virus. And the flexibilities we are offering will be a Godsend to the providers, clinicians, and facilities on the front lines of this fight.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","21:36"
"Seema Verma","And later, CMS is going to be issuing guidance, directing nursing homes to temporarily restrict all visitors and non-essential personnel with a few exceptions such as end of life situations. We fully appreciate that this measure represents a severe trial for residents of nursing homes and those who love them, but we are doing what we must to protect our vulnerable elderly. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","22:14"
"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. As I said in my address to the nation the other night, all Americans have a role to play in defeating this virus. Our most effective weapon right now is to limit the damage to our people and our country and slow the spread of the virus itself. The choice we make-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","22:41"
"Donald Trump","… spread of the virus itself. The choice we make, the precautions we put into place, are critical to overcoming the virus, reducing its spread and shortening the duration of the pandemic which is what it is. The CDC has published guidelines on the coronavirus.gov to enable… It’s coronavirus.gov. It’s very heavily used right now, I will say, to enable every American to respond to this epidemic and to protect themselves, their families and their communities. While the risks to young and healthy Americans remains very low, we’ve learned a lot about this over the last two weeks. Anyone can be a carrier for the virus and risk transmission to older Americans and those with underlying health conditions. And those who are most at risk, they have not done very well. Older Americans, especially if they have a health problem, they have not done well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","23:03"
"Donald Trump","We must take all precautions and be responsible for the actions that we take, and that we see other people take. We want to prevent the spread and transmission of the disease. It’s incredible what’s happening with the sporting world, where so many of the great sports that we’ve gotten so used to at this time of the year, they’re not going to be meeting. They’ve done a great service, actually. But that would be another way that problems could be caused.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","24:06"
"Donald Trump","But this is why I outlined on Wednesday night, my administration’s… The fact that we’ve issued a requirement suspending all medically unnecessary visits to various places. But in particular, nursing homes. We should all be working off the same playbook when it comes to protecting Americans. We have to. We need to be consistent in adopting measures to limit the spread of the virus. The virus is the same whether it’s spreading in cities, towns, or rural communities. The tools and tactics for attacking it are similar, no matter where you go. No matter where you go, you have some hotspots throughout the world right now that people would have never thought possible, and they’re being very seriously affected.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","24:40"
"Donald Trump","Key among these efforts, are breaking chains of transmission between people. These measures have been adopted by many companies, universities and schools. We want to protect the safety and the health of their employees and their students. I encourage everyone to follow the guidelines we’ve issued by CDC, and these common sense measures. A lot of it is common sense. For the areas where the virus is spreading, the CDC is advising communities to postpone large gatherings, postpone assemblies, social functions and sporting events, stagger recess and lunch for schools that aren’t canceled, limit in-person meetings, increase scheduled cleanings, and cancel work-sponsored travel, among numerous other steps that can be taken.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","25:27"
"Donald Trump","Americans are the strongest and most resilient people on Earth. And in the coming weeks, we will all have to make changes and sacrifices. But these short term sacrifices will produce long term gain. Again, I’ve said we’re learning a lot for the future and future problems like this, or worse. Or worse, it could get worse. The next eight weeks are critical. We can learn, and we will turn a corner on this virus. Some of the doctors say it will wash through and will flow through, in interesting terms, very accurate. I think you’re going to find in a number of weeks, it’s going to be a very accurate term.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","26:17"
"Donald Trump","In times of hardship. The true character of America always shines through. We live in the company of the greatest heroes and the most inspiring citizens anywhere in the world. We want to take care of our people. We want to draw on the strength of our history, draw on the strength of our people. Then we will get through this. All together, we will just get through it. So much progress has already been made. And frankly, the numbers because the steps that have been taken, are at a level that a lot of people are surprised… especially when you compare them with other places with far smaller populations.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","27:02"

And to those families and citizens who are worried and concerned for themselves and their loved ones, I want you to know that your federal government will unleash every authority, resource and tool at its disposal, to safeguard the lives and health of our people.

"Donald Trump","What we have done and we are going to be leaving a very indelible print for the future in case something like this happens again. But it was a… And that’s not the fault of anybody.

"Tony Fauci","So just to reiterate what I said to many of you multiple times, it’s a dissent of a system. The system was not designed… For what it was designed for, it worked very well. The CDC designed a good system. If you want to get the kind of blanket testing and availability that anybody can get it, or you could even do surveillance to find out what the penetrance is, you have to embrace the private sector. And this is exactly what you’re seeing, because you can’t do it without it. So when I said that, I meant the system was not designed for what we need.

As far as the cruise line business, we’re with them all the way. It’s a great business. It’s a great U.S. business, frankly. I know how important they are to the country. That includes airlines.

Several cruise lines have announced a 60-day pause in operations. Our Department of Homeland Security has praised them for doing that, because of the unique health challenges particularly presented to seniors with underlying conditions. We have a proposal from the cruise line industry, but they’re currently considering what other steps that they might take. Perhaps even similar to what those other lines have taken.

How long will the American people have to remain on this emergency footing? And for Dr. Berks, as the administration tries to get its arms around this test kit shortage issue, the next glaring need could respirators and related hospital equipment. So what is the administration doing right now to ramp up production of respirators and that kind of equipment, should this outbreak persist?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","40:29"
"Tony Fauci","When you have an outbreak like this, particularly if you’re trying to interfere with it, it’s really impossible to predict the time element of when it’s going to peak and when it’s naturally going to go down. So if you look at the situation where countries really did not get to the point of trying to contain and mitigate very well, you see a peak over several weeks, and then down again over other several weeks. What we’re trying to do with the efforts that we’re doing, is to blunt that peak. And I mentioned it many times. And I think it’s important and appropriate for me to mention it again, because it answers your question.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","41:00"
"Tony Fauci","When you talk about preventing infections from without in, which is the kind of travel restrictions we’re talking about, then how do you handle what you already have in your country? You continue some sort of containment, but you also do mitigation. And you try to proportionate to the areas where there are the most infections. The success of that and how much you make this turn into this, is going to give you the amount of time. If we’re successful, it’ll be less. If we’re not successful, it’s going to be more. But these kind of things generally run out in a few months. Hopefully, we’ll make it several weeks. Eight, nine, whatever weeks. But I can’t give you a number, because it depends on how successful we are.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","41:35"
"Deborah Birx","Great. Thank you. It’s a great question. Dr. Fauci and I have worked together a very long time, and continue. It’s a privilege to work with him every day. I think you can learn very… I appreciate there was some graphics done by some of the reporting over the last several days. If you align the data from China with the data with South Korea, you can start to see almost a complete overlay of that data. So that’s what we’re tracking very closely, as well as Italy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","42:21"
"Deborah Birx","But you have an excellent question. I just want to make one note. In South Korea, I want to repeat, only 4% of the tests were positive. That means 96% of the people had a different respiratory disease. Because we’re in the middle of flu season, cold season, and all of the other respiratory diseases that we get every day. In LabCorp and Quest’s early data, they’re running about 1% to 2% positive. That means that we have a lot more other respiratory disease out there besides the coronavirus, and that’s why the screening is critical. But even with the screening, we’re going to run what we think are very low rates.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","42:47"
"Deborah Birx","Needless to say though, we’re taking it extraordinarily seriously to plan for what could come. What Dr. Fauci talked about, blunting the curve, that makes it much less high need at that peak of the curve that we’re all planning for. So we’re in full inventory of all of our assets by the President, on lacking and this emergency order and the Secretary of HHS’s ability. It unlocks all of those stockpiles, those needs. What the VA has, what the DOD has, what the National Guard has, and what every hospital has. The hospital emergency preparedness plan allows them to defer elective issues to keep those hospital beds open for those who might need it. So we’re in full planning mode for each of those things.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","43:25"
"Donald Trump","I might add that we are in the process and in some cases have already done it, ordered a large number of respirators just in case. We hope we don’t need them, but we’ve ordered a large number. Yeah.

"Donald Trump","Well, some were making progress. Some are not, as you know. But some are making progress. And as they make progress, as they get down to the number that we all think is right, that they know is right, we know is right, we’ll be opening it up. Some are really moving along rapidly.

"Tony Fauci","I don’t mean to diminish your question, but we already know why it would affect senior citizens more. Because when you talk about anything that requires a robust immune system, as you get older, your immune system is not as potent as it is when you were young. And that’s the reason why when you talk about-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","45:42"
"Tony Fauci","When you were young, and that’s the reason why when you talk about even influenza, which we have extraordinary experience with over decades and decades, the people who are very vulnerable are the elderly and those with underlying conditions. The same thing holds true for a variety of other disease. Why cancer is more prevalent in some, in mostly in older individuals. Of course, the immune system that screens for it is less robust, so it really is something that is kind of well known over a lot of studies.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","46:03"

"Donald Trump","No. We have our deal with China. They’re going to be buying $250 billion worth of goods and 50 billion from our farmers, and it’s a great deal for our country. It’s about time somebody did that and, frankly, phase two, we’ll start negotiating.

One of the reasons we have 40 and others have … and again, that number’s going up, just so you understand, and a number of cases which are very small, relatively speaking, it’s going up, but we’ve done a great job because we acted quickly, we acted early, and there’s nothing we could have done that was better than closing our borders to highly infected areas.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","48:41"

When I say everybody, we’re in touch with many of the countries that you know about that you’re writing about, and they’re calling us asking for advice. They’re asking for the advice of the people behind me. Italy’s got a tough situation, but they have really clamped down, and I think they’re going to see some very good results.

"Mike Pence","As the President said, and Dr. Fauci has articulated, the nature of our current system where the CDC has samples sent and tests are performed or state labs perform tests, or in some cases, university and hospital labs perform tests, is generally adequate for an infectious disease or for people getting diagnostic work done, but given the sheer scale of this, the President tasked us with bringing together this extraordinary public and private partnership. Today, by some estimates, when you add all the labs together, and today the President made it possible for every state in the country and their state labs to authorize labs across their state to do Coronavirus testing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","55:08"
"Mike Pence","We’re estimating somewhere between 15 and 20,000 tests a day are able to be performed, but very soon with the program that was announced today, Americans will be able to visit one of the sites closest to them, as described on the website, if they’re symptomatic, if the questionnaire indicates it, be able to have a test there, and these incredible companies will process the test and they’ll receive that information. For now, the best advice that we can give for people is to speak to their doctor, as the President just said. If the doctor indicates, that physician, if it’s not a university hospital or an otherwise authorized lab, can contact the state lab.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","55:56"
"Mike Pence","Again, every state lab in the country can perform tests today, but what the President charged us with when I was tasked to take over the White House Coronavirus task force was open up tests all across the country. The President said a few days ago that we made it clear that any American that wanted to get a test would be able clinically to get a test. I literally heard from the Governor of Washington state who said the doctors in Washington state were saying that if you were only mildly symptomatic, they would not order a test. Fortunately, the President directed CDC to clarify that. Now anyone in consultation with their physician, regardless of their symptoms, can request a test, and their doctors will contact those agencies, those labs in their state, but very soon, Americans will be able to go to these drive-in sites and be able to obtain and participate in a test.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","56:44"

"Deborah Birx","No, I think that’s perfectly said. Just to review one more time about the testing, with Lab Corp and Quest, I think many of you have been to doctor’s office and seen the little boxes outside. What they do is they deliver both the specimen collection piece, because remember it’s a nasal swab, it’s not a tube of blood, so they’ve delivered that to doctor’s offices and hospitals, and then they will arrange to pick that up. The important piece in this all is they’ve gone from a machine that may have a lower throughput to the potential to have automated extraction. I know you don’t want all these details, but it’s really key for the laboratory people. It’s an automated extraction of the RNA that then runs in an automated way on the machine with no one touching it, and the result comes out at the other end. Sample to machine to results. That cuts out a lot of the manual pieces that were happening that were delaying the test results.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","57:42"
"Speaker 10","So with that, what’s the timeline like from when you’re tested to when you get results? Like next week, what should people expect?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","58:41"
"Deborah Birx","With the prior testing, it was taking several days because the test is slower. We believe with this test, because of its throughput, that the testing can be from start, remember it has to transport, to the laboratory that will run it, and then we’re hoping that all can be finished within 24 hours, which is very similar to other tests that you receive today. These are not point-of-care tests. We are working on point-of-care tests, but we have to realize point-of-care tests take six months or more to develop, so we’re not waiting for those. We’re still diagnosing this on nucleic acid, so it is an antibody. This is actually the antigen, the actual virus in your nose that we’re amplifying.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","58:47"
"Donald Trump","I think you have to remember though, we’re working very closely with states and to those you have a smaller form and more targeted form of government going in and doing it, like in New York where the relationship is very good. Like Gavin Newsom, where he made some very complimentary … that’s California. He made some really complementary comments the other day about how we’re working together. We worked on the ship together, but we worked on a lot of other things together having to do with this, and really, the relationship that we have, I can’t think of a bad relationship. We’re helping them, we’re funding them, in some cases, depending on what it is you’re talking about, and we’re all working together very closely. So we’ve done really, I think, a tremendous job of teamwork with the different states.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","59:34"

"Donald Trump","I thought. I knew you would.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:00:36"
"Speaker 11","I do have one for them because I haven’t heard this yet.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:00:37"
"Donald Trump","I was waiting for that. Go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:00:42"

"Donald Trump","Ask them first please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:00:42"
"Speaker 11","Yes, I will. Okay, with regards to the CEOs, can you please tell us when you expect to see items like hand sanitizer, that have been going out of stock very quickly, back on the shelves? There have been a lot of reports about that, and for you, Mr. President, could you talk about a potential bailout for the cruise industry? You had suggested that could happen. Is that something you’re still looking at, and how much would that be?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:00:43"
"Donald Trump","Well, I didn’t suggest that it could happen, but I could tell you it’s an industry that was very badly impacted by what’s going on with the virus. It’s a great industry, it’s a very important industry, and we will be helping them and we will be helping the airline industry if we have to, assuming we have to. So far people haven’t been asking, but if they should be asking, we want to make sure our airlines are very strong, and then in one day all of a sudden wasn’t looking so good. Interestingly, I was talking to Doug, and the numbers they’re doing from the retailing standpoint I guess because of this, your business is like the opposite. All of you have been selling a lot of stuff. Do you want to answer the question as to the hand sanitizers?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:01:07"
"Doug","Sure. Specifically the areas where we’re seeing pressure in the supply chain are surface cleaners, cleaning supplies, paper goods in particular. Hand sanitizer is going to be very difficult to have 100% in stock on for some time. We’re still replenishing it and shipping it, but as soon as it hits the stores it’s going. The same thing’s true for the categories I just mentioned, so all the retailers will be working hand-in-hand with the suppliers to bring that to the market as fast as we can.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:01:51"
"Speaker 11","What is your advice though for Americans who are seeking those items? What is your advice? They’re selling out online, they’re selling out in the stores.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:02:13"
"Doug","I think this team has given you other examples of what people can do to fight back against this virus, and you should look at the entire list.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:02:20"

"Donald Trump","Please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:02:31"
"Tony Fauci","Obviously it sounds very simplistic, but wash your hands as often as you possibly can. I know you’re not always in a position to be able to wash your hands, but wash them just as much as you can. If you don’t have the alcohol wipes, try and get them. If you can’t get them, just try as best as possible to do it. You got to do the best you can.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:02:34"
"Speaker 13","Just general preparedness. You want to wash your hands, you want to keep distance from people, and if you’re around someone sick, keep away from them. This is basic, basic public health. Now these guys are selling a lot of toilet paper. Tony, do you need to give some guidance that toilet paper is not an effective protection against getting the Coronavirus. They’re selling out, but the soap and water, hot water, soap, 20 seconds. That’s how you do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:02:55"
"Donald Trump","Okay, one more. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, over you. Behind you. Behind you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:03:23"
"Speaker 14","Thank you very much, Mr. President. You have a great team, of course.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:03:28"

"Speaker 14","My question, Mr. President, are you happy from the Chinese response? What correctly really told you what really happened those days? Second, Prime Minister Modi of India have closed borders until April 15th, if you have spoken with the prime minister of India, and if they have needed any help? Finally, sir, any method for the small businesses, because they are losing some business because of this. Thank you, sir.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:03:32"
"Donald Trump","On small businesses, the Small Business Administration is now stacked with money to help them, and we’re going to make the money readily available if they need it, small businesses. We had a great time in India. It was an incredible two days, and he’s a great friend of mine and he’s a friend of his people, because he was greeted incredibly warmly, as was I in that stadium. It was an incredible event, and I loved being with him, so just to say “hello” to him.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:03:58"
"Donald Trump","We talked about everything. We’ve talked about far more than just borders, and as far as President, he, likewise, he’s a friend of mine. I believe that we are dealing in good faith, that we just worked, as you know and as I just said. We just worked an incredible deal, big deal, one of the biggest deals ever made of any kind. Big, even by the standards of some of the people here, the deal with China, but I think that they want to get to the bottom of things also.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:04:28"
"Donald Trump","We’re working, our drug companies, our pharmaceutical companies, are working very closely with China and with India, as you know, and with all over the world, and they’re all over the world. These are magnificent companies that are very, very knowledgeable and we’re very lucky to have them, because I think you’re going to come up with, whether it’s therapeutic or whether it’s just help. Helping getting better, and then ultimately a vaccine, which takes a little bit longer because of the test periods and couple of other reasons. You’re going to have it very quickly because of the great knowledge. They’ll have it very quickly. They’ve made a tremendous amount of progress.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-declares-coronavirus-national-emergency","Donald Trump Speech Transcript: Declares Coronavirus National Emergency","01:04:55"
