"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Hello, Newport News. I know it well. I know it well. I know it well. You know, my father and I had a couple of little jobs here and they were great. When the ships came in, they were packed. When the ships out, they were stone cold empty. I said, “This is a different kind of a place.” But we loved it, and it’s a great place. And I’m thrilled to be back in the Commonwealth of Virginia with the thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots. And I also want to thank the great people of North Carolina. Who’s here from North Carolina? Not bad, it’s a little area there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","08:35"
"Donald Trump","39 Days from now, we’re going to win Virginia. We’re going to win North Carolina. We’re going to win four more years in the white house and keep doing what we’ve been doing because it’s never been anything quite like it. This is the most important election in the history of our country. One of the biggest issues for the people of Virginia is your second amendment. And if sleepy Joe Biden wins, your second amendment will be eliminated and your firearms will be confiscated. Whether you like it or not. When asked if a Biden administration was coming after your guns, Biden replied, “Yes.” Fully had to say yes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","09:23"
"Donald Trump","He promised to put the gun grabber, Beto O’Rourke … you know Beto, Beto. Remember Beto? He was on the cover of a third rate magazine and he said, “I was born to run for president.” That was the end of his run. That’s what it ended. Anytime they say they were born to do it they got problems. That didn’t work out, it was a steep drop. But he put Beto in charge of his assault on your guns and you know what happened with Beto, Beto went crazy. He wants to take your guns away. Biden vows to impose punishing taxes on gun owners. Outlaw many of the most popular firearms in America, create a national gun registry, and wage the most aggressive war on gun rights in US history.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","10:15"
"Donald Trump","Biden will disarm law abiding Americans. At the same time, they’ll have riots down your street and that’s just fine. That’s okay. That’s okay, according to the left wing. Only by voting for me can you save your country and can you save your second amendment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","11:06"
"Donald Trump","So I was told not to go for Virginia. We did really well last time and I never came, I never did anything, and we did really well. I said, “Why didn’t I go for Virginia?” But it’s traditionally not a Republican state over the last number of decades. And I said, “Why not?” You have a crazy governor and every time I see it, every two weeks he’s trying to take your guns away, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","11:27"
"Donald Trump","And he’ll attack constantly right to life. And you know, he’s so far left, he doesn’t even talk about late term, he talks about after the baby was born. Which is the first time I ever heard of that. You hear late term, but he said and after the baby is born we’ll start talking to mother. In other words, he’s talking about execution of the baby. Execution. You have a governor that thinks he’s Michael Jackson. Remember his wife saved him. Remember he wanted to prove that he was just dressed up like Michael Jackson and that he sometimes thought when he was young that he resembled Michael Jackson. I don’t think so. And you remember he wanted to moonwalk across the stage and his wife said, “No, no, don’t do it, darling. Don’t please, darling.” Nobody moonwalks like Michael. That would have been good, I wish I could have seen that. That would not have been pretty.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","11:58"
"Donald Trump","So based on your governor and based on the fact that he’s always … every like month you’re fighting for guns. If I’m not here, your second amendment is gone and I’m talking about all over the country. Forget about just Virginia. So I said, “Let’s give Virginia shot.” We’re nearby, right? We’re nearby. I even said, “We’ll bring in the heavy artillery. We’ll bring in our great vice president, Mike Pence.” Did he do a good job?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","13:05"
"Donald Trump","I’ll tell you what, Kamala, Kamala is no Mike Pence. She’s no Mike Pence. No, he’s great. He’s done a fantastic job. And he’s with you all the way. So I said, “Let’s give it a shot.” And you know, there’s a big difference. I tell you what, there’s never been a bigger difference between candidates or parties, never been. No party that supports, as an example, what he would do to a child after it was born is fit to be even involved in any way in this nation, let alone running this nation. As you know, sleepy Joe Biden endorsed your governor. So that means he endorsed the policy of your governor. That means he endorsed breaking up your second amendment. So it’ll either be totally broken up or it will be wiped out. Essentially it won’t be that much different.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","13:45"
"Donald Trump","So here we are in Virginia. Like I had nothing to do today. I woke at six in the morning, I read some papers. I read the fake news. And then I was in Florida early in the morning, and then I went to Florida and we did a big round table with the Hispanics. They were great. And then we flew to Atlanta from Florida, Palm Beach. And then we flew … We started off in all different places. We were all … And then we flew, we went to Miami. We started off. But I’ll tell you what, Florida’s great. We’re going to win Florida. We’re way up in Florida. Way up. Way up. Even a poll that gave me … I mean, I’ve never had a good number. ABC/Washington Post poll, it’s a terrible poll, always been bad. I think it got everything wrong four years ago. They said I’m four up or more, but I’m four up in the State of Florida. So anyway, so we went to Miami, went to a beautiful place actually in Miami, you know where that is, right? And we had, I won’t say because then they’ll say I’m advertising if I do [inaudible 00:15:58]. I won’t say. I won’t say the name of the place, but it is beautiful. And then what happened is we went to Atlanta and we … so we left the great Hispanics. We call them the Latinos for Trump. Latino.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","14:41"
"Donald Trump","Where we are polling at numbers that I guess no Republican has ever polled before. Perhaps Abraham Lincoln, but in those days he wasn’t big into the Hispanic movement. I think Abraham had other things to think about, don’t we think? But I will say this, nobody has done more for many communities, but I always say for the Black community, nobody has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump since Abraham Lincoln. Nobody.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","16:18"
"Donald Trump","So we flew to Atlanta and we had an unbelievable two hours. And this was with the African American community, the Black community. I always say, “What do you like better? Tell me what you like better.” They say, “Usually the Black community.” And what is the answer, tell me? African American. I don’t want to hear from other people, I want to hear. African American. What do you like better? African American or Black? It’s Black. Yeah, that’s what we hear. I’ll go with whatever you want. That’s your choice. We can use either one. I’ll go with whatever you want.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","16:52"

"Donald Trump","And then we flew to Washington where we had a round table. And then I say, “Well, that’s it for the night, right?” You know, this starts at six in the morning. So I said, “That’s it for the night? Is that it? I’ll go back home to the White House.” No, sir. Well, I wonder what … You’re going to Virginia, sir. Good. That’s good. Thank you, very much. This was like, I asked the question about an hour ago,” where am I going now?” Put me in coach, you ever hear the expression? Just wind me up and put me in coach. I said, “Where are we going tonight?” I said, “Let’s go back to the White House, let’s see our first lady.” And they said, “No, sir, you have a rally scheduled. You have a rally scheduled.” Where is it? In Virginia. I said, “That’s good. How many people?” They said, “A hell of a lot of people. That’s [inaudible 00:18:40].”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","17:50"

What the hell.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","18:39"

"Donald Trump","No, so we’re going to put a heavy play in for Virginia. Seriously, we’re going to put a heavy play in Virginia. And I think we can win this state. Man, that crowd is big. Look at that, it goes way back to the hanger. That is a big crowd. That’s good. You know, I always tell the cameras, “I don’t want to bore people with this,” but I implore them, turn the cameras around and show them the size of this crowd. It Goes back to the building. But they never like doing it because they don’t like including Fox, they don’t like showing big crowds. You know, they don’t like showing big crowds. We left Ohio. We’re way up in Ohio. Way up in Ohio. We’re way up in Georgia. We were in Georgia today though with the governor and the senator, Senator Perdue. And Representative Doug Collins, great guy, Kelly Loeffler, great person, Senator, and Senator Perdue. And I said, “How are we doing?” They said, “You’re winning by a lot in Georgia. You’re winning by a lot.” Of course, if you see these people, they’ll say, “He’s pretty close in Georgia. Too close to call.” And then we have election night comes, the polls in Georgia are close. Donald Trump has won the State of Georgia.” You only win if you’re up by, like a lot. If you’re by a lot, they announce it … That was what happened with Texas last time. They said Texas is too close to call. All for months and months and months. The only one that didn’t believe that were the people in Texas. So when it closed, they said the polls in Texas are closed, Donald Trump has won-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","19:17"
"Donald Trump","The polls in Texas are closed. Donald Trump has won that state, like in the same breath. Nah, we’re doing great in Texas. We’re doing great all over the place. We’re doing great all over. I hear we’re up in New Hampshire, which is great. Last time that one got taken away from us with the people that just came in with buses all over the place. They had buses coming up from Massachusetts. You have the RINO governor, you know, the RINO governor of Massachusetts, right? Baker. He’s a RINO but I guess he does whatever he can to get elected.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","21:03"

"Donald Trump","Fill that seat. Oh, we’re going to fill it, don’t worry about it. And the Republicans have been very unified. You see that, very unified. Even a couple of people that normally don’t vote for with us. You know, they usually don’t vote with the Republicans, but they are. And we have tremendous unity in the party. Mitch is doing a good job. Kevin is doing a good job. We’re going to take over the House. We’re going to take back the House. People are tired of craziness.

That’s whose fault it is. That’s whose fault it is. But you know, it’s an amazing thing because the Democrats are saying, “Well, it’s the end of a term.” You know, we have a lot of time left. Think think of this. If it were them… Don’t forget, we don’t have to do it by the election. But we should be really able.

"Donald Trump","You know, they say the biggest thing you can do is the appointment of judges, but especially the appointment of Supreme Court Justices. That’s the single biggest thing a president can do because it sets the tone of the country for 40 years, 50 years. I mean a long time. So we’re going to be announcing somebody great. I just watched, the great thing about Air Force One there are more televisions on that plane than any plane. They got them in every room. You open up for closet. You want a shirt. Let me open, “Oh, there’s a television.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","23:15"

We have a lot of time, and if they weren’t in opposition, they would do the same thing. Maybe they would just do it more rapidly. Okay? More rapidly. So tomorrow I think is going to be a big day. Five o’clock tomorrow at the White House, we’re going to be naming the nominee, hopefully will be on that court for 50 years. Five-oh, fifty years. Be on there for 50 years. The only thing I can tell you for sure is it will be a woman.

I heard their pledge of allegiance. They had it in their caucus. I’m watching. I said, “Oh, they made a mistake.” I said to the First Lady, “Darling, they made a mistake.

You know, at least put it in a little bit different. 31 different phones. Like what is it? 21 people, 31 phones. But that’s okay. That’s okay. That’s only illegal.

We would fix that like we did Minneapolis. We would fix that up in less than a half an hour. Remember Minneapolis, they were a riot. I mean, the problem is they invited us in about two weeks. By the time they invited, it was a lot of flames behind them. Remember the reporter, he’s standing there. “This is a peaceful protest,” and behind him, you have like blocks.

You’re going to be cheering like crazy, because I think you’ll like this.

And because I happen to like this state a lot, I said, ” What about Virginia? What about North Carolina?” And somebody said, “I don’t know.

You know, the question was asked to me, “How well did we do on the pandemic?” And I said, “I give us an A to an A+.” You look at the ventilators. You look at all we’ve done. We did a great job. We helped the governors. The governors are always very thankful. Then sometimes they’ll get in front of a camera. They’ll remember, some of them are Democrats, right?

You know, he shouldn’t have gotten it, because if Pocahontas left two days early, Bernie would have won. And we would have had Bernie. I don’t know who I would have been better against.

And that includes you, that includes tobacco, that includes a lot of things, but that includes your farmers. But you go back to their primaries, right? Go back to the primary, the Iowa, the first primary, it was done with ballots. They have no idea. Remember the disaster? And that’s a small primary.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","55:26"
"Donald Trump","Now, they’re talking about tens of millions of these fake ballots going all over the place. Who’s sending them? Where are they being sent? Who’s sending them back? Supposing they don’t get them, are they being sent to Democrat areas? And they’re all run by Democrat governors, right? All of them, 100%. It’s 100%. So you have a guy in Nevada, he just comes up with the idea. I think we’re going to win Nevada. If fairly, we’re going to win it. But he comes up, “Well, you don’t have to have your signature verified.” Oh, that’s nice. That’s good. He decided let’s do that. But you know a real big problem? I like watching television and have, “The winner is…” Right? You might not hear it for months, because this is a mess. Go back and study what happened in Iowa. Take a look, take a look at what happened in New York, in a small congressional race, Carolyn Maloney.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","56:21"
"Donald Trump","She should have lost the race, in my opinion. They gave it to her, because it was a crooked deal. The guy that she ran against was having fits. He said, “What are you doing? What are you doing?” Everything was mixed up. The ballots were lost. There was fraud. There was everything. Go into Patterson, New Jersey… These are just recently. It’s a disaster waiting to happen. And the only one that knows it better than we do are the Democrats. They know this is going to happen. They want it to happen, because they want to go through a court system. And instead, you’re not going to hear, very unlikely that you’re going to hear a winner that night. I could be leading and then they’ll just keep getting ballots and ballots and ballots and ballots. Because now, they’re saying that the ballots can come in late. Well, what does that mean? And more importantly, they’re going to be given, in some cases, a week or two weeks to count the ballots. So if we’re waiting for one state…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","57:18"
"Donald Trump","No, think of it. If we’re waiting… And this is, they’re talking about five, six, seven states that have this problem. So if we’re waiting for one state, does that mean the whole nation, the whole world, is going to wait for one state? I won’t use any names, but you have Pennsylvania, where you have a Democrat, who by the way, lost the case last week. We sued. We want him to open up his state and we won, on constitutional grounds. North Carolina, they have the state all locked up. So we’re talking about, these are the governors that run their states for Democrats. They really do. I mean, they run them, they’re Democrat governors, and they’re in charge of the count. We went to Nevada to make a speech. We had five different sites. The governor made it impossible, so we ended up at a different site. We had to get one very… This is the guy that’s in charge of ballots. He was a political hack. Now, he’s the governor. And this guy is in charge of ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","58:12"
"Donald Trump","It’s not going to work. It’s going to be a disaster. And I want a smooth, beautiful transition, but they don’t add the other part, but it’s got to be an honest vote. And everybody knows, just go back again, look at Iowa, look what happened. Just take a look at that. They still don’t know who won. They didn’t know weeks later. Remember New Hampshire went, New Hampshire, declared a winner. And essentially, they don’t know what happened in Iowa. Except the difference is, we’re doing the same thing, but with tens of millions of ballots. This is a disaster waiting to happen and they shouldn’t let this system go. If you ask for a ballot, it’s called solicited. You solicit. You want the ballot, it comes in, you sign it, you send it back. That’s okay. But where they send millions and millions of unsolicited ballots, people get ballots, they didn’t even know they were getting them. Sign it, sign it. Then they have people going around getting them to sign. When you have that, you don’t need… We have much more enthusiasm. We’re so high up on enthusiasm, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","59:09"
"Donald Trump","But it’s very unfair, because when you have somebody go knock on your door, “Sign,” it’s called harvesting. They’re going to harvest ballots. Even though in some cases, in most cases, it’s illegal. It’s illegal as hell. And it should be illegal. So this is a disaster waiting to happen. And the only hope we have, really, other than going through a long, unbelievable litigation at the end, after it’s over, because we’re going to win. We’re not going to lose this, except if they cheat. That’s the way I look at it. We can’t let them cheat. We can’t let them, it’s too much. Our country is at stake and it’s true. Our country is at stake, because these people will destroy our country. We can’t let this happen. And this is a scam. They know it. The media knows it, but the media doesn’t want to cover it. They know exactly what’s going to happen and so do I, but the Democrats know better than all of us what’s going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:00:15"
"Donald Trump","So we can’t let it, and if you see anything, you just have to report it on everything. We’re all watching. Law enforcement’s watching all over the place, but it’s very hard to watch. Millions of ballots, very hard to watch. And that’s the only way we’re going to lose, is if there’s mischief. Mischief, and it’ll have to be on a big scale, so be careful. And we do want a very friendly transition, but we don’t want to be cheated and be stupid and say, “Oh, let’s…” We’ll go and we’ll do a transition and we know that there were thousands and thousands of ballots that made the difference through cheating. We’re not going to stand for it. We’re not going to stand for it. So just remember, keep your eyes open. For decades, our opponents spent trillions of dollars rebuilding other countries and now we’re finally rebuilding our country. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, all made in the USA. We launched the first new branch of the Armed Forces, think of that, since the Air Force, 75 years ago. It’s called Space Force and it’s a big deal. See, that alone would be a big deal for… Honestly, that alone would be a very big deal for an administration. We did… Think of it. We now have a 6th branch of the United States Armed Forces. That’s a big deal. But we did so much more, so much more. I mean, think of it. It’s incredible. You know what we did, probably the most? We’ll have maybe even more than 300 federal judges, including court of appeals. And now we’re going to have three Supreme Court judges. Their minds are blowing, their mind. You’ve had many presidents, never had one Supreme court judge…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:01:11"
"Donald Trump","You’ve had many presidents never had one Supreme Court judge. We’re going to have three. Of all people! And that’s a record. Of all people to get three Supreme Court justices in one administration, in one term, they are going crazy. They’re saying, “Darling, tell me this is not happening.” But you’ll see it tomorrow at 5:00. With the help of the incredible workers of Newport News and Norfolk Naval Shipyard, we will build 355. We’re going to have a Navy again, of 355 ships. That’s what we need. That’s been depleted. And they’re already being built. We’ve got a few big ones, beauties being built, including aircraft carriers.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:03:03"
"Donald Trump","Biden will slash military funding, and shipbuilding will be shut down. It’s going to be shut down like it used to be. We killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s number one terrorist and mass murderer, Soleimani. I withdrew from last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear catastrophe. What a deal that was. $150 billion, 1.8 billion in cash. You ever see what 1.8 billion in cash? It’s plane loads. These guys over there, they must’ve said, “What the hell is this?” They never saw money like that. We paid it. You know what we got for it? Nothing. Nothing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:03:52"
"Donald Trump","I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’d been working on that for 52 years. I got it done quickly. And instead of endless wars, we are forging peace in the middle East. We even got nominated, right? You know what for? That’s all right. I hate to talk about it, but I have to because the press doesn’t talk about it. No, it was a great honor. It was a great honor. Twice. You know that, right? Twice? The press doesn’t talk about it. The Nobel Peace Prize, huh? Two for different things. For Kosovo and Serbia. We stopped them from killing each other. It was very nice, and they don’t have to kill each other. Been killing each other for a long time. Kosovo, Serbia. It was great. It was great. And we got a nomination for Israel, and you look at Bahrain, UAE. That’s just the beginning. We have them lined up that want to go into that. Well, peace in the Middle East without blood all over the sand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:04:36"
"Donald Trump","And I told you. You heard the story. I went home. I said, “First Lady, I’m going to get the greatest stories tonight. I just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, First Lady.” The Israel, everybody said it couldn’t be done. And they were right. It couldn’t be done the way they were doing it. You would have never gotten it done. The way John Kerry was doing it, you would have never gotten it done. That’s a guy that doesn’t have a clue, incompetent. But you know what? I said, “First Lady, wait till you see this. It’s going to be unbelievable.” And we watched Lester Holt. I don’t even know why. And we had one story after another after another, and after seven stories, I said, “First Lady, this is getting a little embarrassing.” And they never mentioned it, nor did any other of the newscasts. Fake CNN didn’t mention it. MSDNC didn’t mention it. ABC, CBS. Nobody mentioned it. So I was very embarrassed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:05:48"
"Donald Trump","Three days later, I got nominated again. And I said, “My great First Lady, we got another shot at it, darling. Let’s watch the news tonight.” One story, two stories, three stories, four stories, five stories. We got to the end. It wasn’t mentioned again. And when Barack Hussein Obama was nominated, it was. And he didn’t know what he got it for. He still doesn’t. He doesn’t know what he got it for. So we have a little double standard going on, but that’s okay. As long as we know. Sometimes I’ll be talking that way and I’ll look around, I’ll say, “Oh, I’m in the Oval Office. Ha, ha. How did that happen?” I said, “You know, with all the complaining, we’re in the Oval Office, and they’re not, right?” And if you don’t mind, let’s keep it that way, so we can keep this going.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:06:46"
"Donald Trump","We’ve achieved more in 47 months than Joe Biden has achieved in 47 years. It’s true. Biden, without even knowing it, is pushing the most far left platform in history. The Biden plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protection for people with pre-existing conditions. He would terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions. You know, I got the travel ban. Remember? Everyone said you couldn’t do that. I want a travel ban from people that want to blow up our country. Do you think that’s okay?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-newport-news-virginia-campaign-rally-transcript-september-25","Donald Trump Newport News, Virginia Campaign Rally Transcript September 25","01:07:45"
"Donald Trump","People said, “Oh, we don’t like that.” Took a little heat, and we got it. They said I didn’t get it. And they were right. We lost at one court, lost at the second, and then we won in the Supreme Court. They don’t say that. But we have a strong travel ban, and we will use it. We do use it. We use it plenty. And increase refugee admissions. They want to increase refugee admissions 700%, opening the flood gates for radical Islamic terrorism. They want to ban school choice and charter schools. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. Every parent. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s so true. And in conclusion, I love you people, but I’ve been doing this since early in the morning. I’m getting the hell out of here. I would only do this for Virginia. I got a guy, he stays in his damn basement all day long, and I’m doing this. I don’t know, if he wins, I’m going to be very embarrassed. I’ll say, “Gee, I worked so hard, and he didn’t work at all.” Nah, we’re going to win. I think we’re going to win, and I think we’re going to win big. I think we’re going to.

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of the ridiculous, horrible, endless foreign wars, countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will keep you out of them. And by the way, we have weapons the likes of which nobody has ever seen before. We have a level of, a degree of which nobody, from Russia to China to North Korea, nobody’s ever seen what we’ve built, and just hope to God we never have to use them. But we have never had anything like the arsenal that we’ve built over the last three years.

But when I came in, your military was totally depleted. You had old planes. You had old everything. We have, now, the F-35s, and we have things, the bombers, the new bombers, the tankers, the ships that we’re building, some right here, Newport News. Yeah. But we have built an arsenal, the likes of which the world has never seen. And you know what? That will make it a lot easier for us not to have to use them. That’s really what we need. We needed it. We were in bad shape. We were in bad shape. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength.

"Donald Trump","We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, and further reduce health insurance. You know the health insurance is a disaster. And we are bringing the price of health insurance way down. Premiums and costs of prescription drugs, we’re instituting favored nations. We pay the highest in the world for drugs. I negotiated with big pharma, and I just got tired of negotiating. I said, “I’m sorry. We’re instituting favored nations. We’re the largest purchaser of prescription drugs by far in the world.” And I instituted what we call a favored nations clause, where we will pay the same price as the nation that pays the lowest price in the world. In addition to that, I instituted a rebate clause, where we get the rebates instead of the middlemen. These are the richest people. I don’t know who the hell they are, but the middlemen are very rich, and they’re not liking me too much, and you’re going to see a lot of bad ads from big pharma. They’ve already started. Just remember every time you see one of those ads, that means your drug prices are coming way down.

And what we’ve done, we’ve taken all the grass out. It was grass blowing right through the cracks. It was a disgrace. And we’ve now made it the number one space center in the world by far, again. You ought to see this. They were playing golf. They were playing golf. It was all closed up, or essentially closed up. It was actually worse than closed up. You know what?

They used the word prison. I said, “For what?” You knock down a monument or a statue, you go to jail for 10 years. I said, “Give me that, then get it to my office.” And I signed it, and they were coming down to Washington. They were going to knock down two particular statutes that were really beautiful. And I signed it, and we announced it, had a news conference, got to let people know about it. Right?
