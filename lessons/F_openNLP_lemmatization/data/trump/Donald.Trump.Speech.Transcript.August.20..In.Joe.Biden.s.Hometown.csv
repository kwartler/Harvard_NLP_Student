"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. This is really great. We love this state. We won this state. I don’t know if you know what’s going on outside, but that’s … Right, Lou? That’s as many people as you can possibly have all the way back. How did you get in? That’s my question. I know you’re special friends of a group of people that have done a really good job, and I want to thank you very much for being here. But Pennsylvania has been very important to me. I went to school in Pennsylvania, as you know, college, and I love it. Please sit down. And by the time I finished, I’m going to have a nice sunburn right here. This is good.

"Donald Trump","But I want to thank everybody. In 75 days, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years. They’ve had us under siege, and we beat them, and we beat them, and we keep beating them. But I’ll tell you, I’ve never seen anything … No president should have to go through what we’ve gone through. No president. Should never happen. And I watched President Obama last night, and I watched him talking about everything, and I had to put it out. I said, yeah, but he spied on our campaign, and he got caught. That’s about as bad a thing as you can imagine. If that happened to another campaign on the other side, they would have had 25 people in jail for many years already. Many, many years. It’s a disgrace.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","01:02"
"Donald Trump","But in three years, and what we’ve done in just this short period of time, there’s been no administration that’s accomplished what we’ve accomplished, and that’s despite pandemics and despite all of the opposition and all of the witch hunts, the phony witch hunts. No administration has done what we’ve done. We’ve secured our borders, brought back our manufacturing jobs, rebuilt our military, wiped out the ISIS caliphate 100%, killed our terrorist enemies, achieved American energy independence, and guess what? We’re just getting started. That’s just a small part of it. That’s a small part of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","01:46"

Because we’re dealing with crazy people in the other side. They’ve gone totally stone cold crazy. You know, you look at Hillary. She was a lot smarter than Joe. But I’ll tell you, there was a certain sense of sanity four years ago. These people have gone insane, and they’re radical left, and you look at some of the things happening in these Democrat- run cities, which we could solve in two minutes. All they’d have to do is call us, right? Our great ex-congressman. All they have to do is … And thank you for being here. But all they have to do is call us.

"Donald Trump","Joe Biden is a puppet of the radical left movement that seeks to destroy the American way of life. They don’t understand, and probably when it happened, they’d say, what did we ever do? Joe Biden has pledged to hike your taxes by $4 trillion in the largest tax hike in history. And they’re going to waste the money on the Green New Deal, the Green New Deal. You know what you get out of that? Nothing. Nothing except debt and death. They want to eviscerate the Second Amendment. They want to take away your guns. They want to take away your guns. Well, you remember that, just that one point alone, and they want to take away your guns. So who’s going to vote for that? I mean, we want our Second Amendment. I’ve held it strong, and you think it was easy? I’ve held it totally strong.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","03:15"

Shut down the energy fields of Pennsylvania. They want to shut them down. No fossil fuels. No fossil fuel. Texas isn’t too happy, either. Go to Texas. I just left Texas a little while ago, two weeks. I said, they don’t want energy, they don’t want guns, and they don’t want religion. A guy stands up, says, “Not going to win Texas!” But you have the same thing, because you do a big, you’re a big fracking state. You want to see your taxes go up? Stop fracking. Doesn’t hurt you at all, fracking. They want to throw up windmills that are going to ruin your houses. Put up a big windmill. You walk out your door. You’ll see those big monsters churning. But even that they don’t want to do. I don’t think they want to do anything. I think they want to close your businesses.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","04:02"

So the American dream … And by the way, we have a lot of minority groups that live in the suburbs. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, all did phenomenally last year with jobs. Best jobs we’ve ever had in the history of our country, the best economy we’ve ever had. But they’re a big part of the suburbs. And they want to put low income housing in the suburbs at a level that they’ve never done it before. And it’s been a very … Look, this has been going on for 20 years. I terminated the regulation that did that. They said, “Well, we can change that.” I said, “No, let’s terminate it.” People have to aspire to go there.

That wasn’t even DeBlasio that did it. It was Cuomo, the governor. He ended it in New York, and now the crime rate has gone through the roof. The speaker at Biden’s convention, proudly declared, we’re talking about abolishing the police. We’re talking about abolishing ICE, and we’re talking about abolishing prisons. And that’s, the only thing they’re not abolishing are taxes because your taxes are going to go up at a level that you’ve never even heard of before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","06:00"

You’re not going to have law and order. Do you notice? And I shouldn’t say it because he’ll put it in his speech, if he can read it, which I doubt. But they’ll put it in there tonight. I shouldn’t say it because he’s going to speak later. He’s going to have a good audience. People are going to find out what the hell’s going on. I see he hasn’t answered a question since, they just said … Did you see it on the newscasts? Since July 17th. Hasn’t taken a question from the fake news back there. No, think of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","06:40"

It’s one thing I’ve learned, the people heading these other countries, whether it’s President Xi of China, Putin of Russia, Erdogan, Turkey, any of them, Kim Jong Un, North Korea. Remember we’re going to be in war with North Korea? Remember? It’s going to be a war? Right, congressman? There’s going to be a war. If Trump’s, oh, we’re going to have a war. No, it would have been a war if you had Hillary Clinton. Would’ve been a war if Obama were allowed to stay any longer. He thought there was going to be a war. Where’s the war? I don’t see the war. Maybe things happen. You don’t know. But there’s been no war. Nobody killed. He would have lost 25, 30 million people. They don’t say that. They say a hundred thousand people. No, no. Seoul is 32 million people, and it’s right next to the cannon fire. And we have a good relationship with him. I have a good relationship with him. You know, when I say that, isn’t that terrible? They say. No, it’s not terrible. It’s great. It’s great. I have a relationship.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","07:29"

So when I say that we got along and we’ve met, everyone says, oh, that’s so terrible. No, it’s a good thing. It’s a good thing. Not a bad thing. It’s a good thing.

And by the end of the year, we’ll be up to almost 500 miles, and then we’re going to go on a little bit further, some areas that are loose, a little bit loose. We found out.

Hundreds of millions of dollars, I distributed it to the police, whereas Biden and Obama, they didn’t want to do that because they said, no, no, no. It makes the police look too strong.

I left New York four years ago, and I could see, because he’s a terrible mayor, I could see there were things that were happening that were bad. He’s no Rudy Giuliani, I can tell you that. But I could see things were happening. But the last six months, seven months, it just exploded. It’s incredible. Crime up 368%, 368%. It’s crazy. It’s crazy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","10:40"

Did you see the kid get whacked the other day? Just whacked, like he was a piece of garbage? I mean, who could take it?

He’d say he was born here, but he left when he was like eight, nine, or 10. So he left, 68 years ago, he left. Long time ago. So I view it differently. He wasn’t born here. He abandoned Scranton. Okay? His family had something to do with that. You know, his parents. But he loves Scranton. I mean, he keeps talking about, I was born in Scranton. I lived in Scranton. Yeah, for a few years, and then he left for another state. You know the state. But this Scranton stuff. That’s why I figured I’d come here and explain to you one thing. But I think you people know it better than I do. He left! He abandoned Pennsylvania. He abandoned Scranton. He was here for a short period of time and he didn’t even know it. And today it’s amazing.

That’s billions of dollars a year, and the son didn’t even have a job before that. And I asked the Wall Street people, tell me, is that possible? Smartest people, top people on Wall Street. They say, can’t happen. It can’t happen. The smartest people, the people that do get money from every country, from everybody, they say can’t happen.

But he had none. And he even admitted, no, I don’t know anything about energy. But he goes onto an energy company. It’s millions of dollars, 83, it’s actually double that because it was him and some guy that knew less than he did. And is that okay? Yeah? Is it okay when Joe Biden goes and says, a billion dollars, you’re not getting it unless you get rid of those prosecutors. You talk about quid pro quo, right? That’s your quid pro quo.

Joe Biden is no friend of Pennsylvania. He’s actually, for the reasons we just said, he’s your worst nightmare. Biden supported every single globalist attack on Pennsylvania workers, NAFTA, China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which built China into a power, TPP, Korea, the horrible, ridiculous Paris Climate Accord, which stripped our nation of its energy, and the so-called Clean Power Plan.

Does anybody know how big fracking is? You’re not going to be allowed to frack anymore. You’re not going to be allowed. No oil, no nothing. No oil, no gas, no nothing. Just think of that. What would happen is, well, first of all, many of you, I guess 600,000, 670,000 lose their jobs. No money, no oil, higher taxes. Your stock market would crash. If they get in beyond fracking, if they get in, you’ll have your 401ks, which are setting records, by the way, stock market just hit a new high.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","16:03"

And it will happen if we’re stupid and we don’t go out and vote and secure your ballot. Absentee ballots are good. But the stuff where they take millions and millions of ballots and send them all over the place, we’ll grab it and we’ll just put them in a big pile there. Everyone grab it. It’s a disgrace. Even common sense tells you that. Look at New York, look at what happened in New Jersey. Look at what happened in Virginia. Look at what happened.

So this is just a way they’re trying to steal the election and everybody knows that. Because the only way they’re going to win is by a rigged election. I really believe that. I saw the crowd outside. For every sign we had for Trump Pence, every single sign. And that’s not that atypical in Texas. We had people on the highways, on the roadways, we’re driving to some oil well where we gave a speech. It was a 20 minute drive, between the plane and that oil well, there were tens of thousands of people and they had the signs, Trump and Trump Pence and flags, American flags.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","17:33"

And you’ll read tomorrow that he had a massive crowd also. Pennsylvania lost more than one in three manufacturing jobs after NAFTA and China’s entry into the WTO. And that was a vote and courtesy of sleepy Joe. Biden looked American labor into the eyes and took care of dues, their union endorsements and their votes. The unions, I mean the unions have to be more reasonable. They have to be more reasonable. And we love the unions. We love non-union. I’ve had it all.

You have non-unions. What I talk about is the worker. They treated our workers horribly. We lost our jobs to foreign lands. Our workers got fired, whether they were in the unions or not. Then he sold out and he passed the Cadillac tax. You know what that is, on union healthcare plans? Attack their energy jobs and sent their factories to China. And now he’s back begging for their votes. And it’s like a custom, Democrats. Except with me. I came in, I got so many union votes. I get far more. I mean, you’ve seen it.

But these guys right here, are you all union people? I can tell. Are you union? It’s good, right? It’s fine. That’s fine. Look at that. You got a hand. Certain parts of the country, they wouldn’t be as happy, but that’s okay, right? And it’s great. But they were not happy. And you know what was happening? They were not happy when the bosses got endorsed by the Democrats. American labor will vote for Trump Pence in 2020. They’re all saying that. And this area is going to be an incredible area. This used to be all Democrat until I came along. Until I came along, this was Democrat. This was heavily union. It was Democrat.

First of all, the country will be let down because the country, you will see a crash like you’ve never seen before. And as good as those stock market numbers are, there’s a headwind. They headwind is that if he won, the market’s going to crash. The Green New Deal, all of the different things, socialized medicine, that’s what they want. It’s socialized medicine. No doctor, no plan. Obama lied about it 28 times. Do you remember he said, “You can keep your doctor. You can keep your plan.” It wasn’t true. 28 different times, they have them. For the last four years, we’ve been reversing Biden’s betrayals and delivering historic wins. For the people of Pennsylvania, your state lost over 50,000 manufacturing jobs when Biden was vice president. In my first three years, Pennsylvania gained 14, 000 jobs, manufacturing, and going up at a level that nobody’s ever seen before.

My first week in office, I withdrew from the Trans-Pacific partnership. It would have been totally destructive to your jobs. It would have been a horror show. I withdrew from the one-sided Paris climate accord, which would have cost us so many billions of dollars. And all it would have done is made the competition even tougher all over the world. I believe it was designed to hurt the United States and to get jobs away from us and companies. I stood up to China’s rampant cheating, plunder, and theft. I repealed that horrible tax. So many taxes. How many taxes did I repeal? I’m getting a list of them now, I’ll have it for you for the next meeting. Because I’ll be back to Pennsylvania, that I promise. And I’m standing up to the special interests and to big pharma. Weeks ago, I signed four historic directives to dramatically reduce the cost of prescription drugs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","22:39"
"Donald Trump","Think of it. You know what I did? I signed, as you know and as you’ve seen, I guess, but other countries have sometimes 10% of what we pay for the same exact pill, same drug, same prescription drug. And I signed a deal that we get, it’s not signed by the drug companies, they hate it. They’ll take in advertising. Whenever you see bad ads on me from drug companies, just remember one thing, that means your prices are coming down. That means your prices. But it’s called Favored Nations, Favored Nations.

They could have done that a long time ago. Biden could have done it. He didn’t know what it meant. But I will tell you, most people do know what, but they can’t do it because big pharma is the most powerful group. And I guess they say, number one, is it number one, mister? But you didn’t take any money from big pharma, right? I bet you didn’t. I’ll bet you didn’t, my man. I ended the NAFTA disaster and I signed USMCA in Deloitte. USMCA is phenomenal. And it’s going to keep your companies from moving to Mexico and other places. After years of building up other nations, we’re finally building up our nation and we are finally doing something that I’ve been talking about for years. We’re finally putting America first, and I’ve done that right from the beginning.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","24:35"

Lloyd, thank you. Thank you, Lloyd. John Joyce. John, thank you. Great job. Great job. And a friend of mine and a great, great man. He would have been here forever if he decided to, but he decided maybe it was time to do something else. But this was a fighter like no other fighter. And those three other gentlemen will attest, right? Our friend Lou Barletta. Lou. And they’re shouting. I’m saying this for the media. They’re shouting “Lou”, they’re not booing. They’ll say, “He stood up and he got booed horribly. It was a horrible embarrassing.” No, that’s what they do. They’re fake. Thanks also to our congressional candidates, Jim Bognet.

Dan Tabas, what a great man he was. I don’t know if you know him, but he started out with about 2 cents and he ended up being a rich man. And he employed a lot of people and he was a real friend of mine. That was long before I ran for politics. He didn’t like many people, but he liked Trump. Right? People would go, “He’s a rough guy.” People would go up to him and say, “Hi, Dan. How you doing?” He became a very successful guy. And he’d look out and say, “I don’t want to talk to anybody.

We added seven million jobs nationwide, including 209,000 new jobs in Pennsylvania. By the way, in the last three months, right Bernie? Over nine million jobs, an all time record. This is now during and hopefully closing moments of the pandemic. You notice how they, anytime there’s a good country, they like to compare, because we’ve done an incredible job. You look at our mortality rates, you look at all the things. But they like to compare us to others. So they were talking about New Zealand. New Zealand, it’s over, it’s over for Zealand.

How did they all get out there? And they were not socially distanced, I can tell you. We’ll have to. On the way back, they’ll still be there because they’re incredible people. But what is he doing? He’s got you in a shutdown, still. Shut down wolf. He can’t do this. He’s going to destroy your soul. What happens is depression, anxiety problems with family members, drugs, heart attacks, obesity.

They’ve got to open this state up and you have to do it, right? This wonderful, incredible Commonwealth. Right? I would call it a Commonwealth. Do you ever mind of they call it a state? No, call it Commonwealth. Whatever the hell you want to open it up. And what is he doing? What is he doing? So the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, we’re going to get it open.

And the results are not good. The results, it’s not like, “Oh, this is wonderful.” The results in some of these places, as worse than those that are open. And you have other states. I mean, you look at the country, it’s really, we have states we’re thriving, we’re thriving. And there’s no shutdown. It’s enough.

And through the Paycheck Protection Program, we saved nearly two million Pennsylvania jobs. We’ve also delivered nearly … That’s right. Two million jobs. We delivered nearly $11 billion in direct support to Pennsylvania families. And over the past three months, we’ve gained over nine million jobs. Nobody could even believe the numbers. And watch.

You had a massive number of deaths in nursing homes, but 95 year old mother as I read. And I said, “Well, that person will be gone very quickly.” And that person is still there. I would say that’s something that if somebody ever wants to run for the governor of Pennsylvania, that would be something good to use.

So everything that we’ve gained over the last number of months, he wants to lock it down. No, we’re doing good. Florida’s going down substantially. Arizona, done a great job in Arizona.

He’s going to outlaw it.

Take your job, turn your family against you for speaking your mind, while they indoctrinate your children with twisted, twisted, worldviews that nobody ever thought possible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","50:03"
"Donald Trump","You notice they’re not knocking down statues and monuments anymore because when I saw what was happening I took an old law and I signed a nice new executive order. Then I explained, “10 years, if you knock down a statue, federal statue, or monument.” They were all set to March on Washington. “We’re going to knock down some nice statues,” and then they said, “You know what? Let’s not march.” The march ended very quickly. There was no more marching. They said, “You know, 10 years that’s a long time.” That’s a long time to knock over a statue that many people love and many people don’t. There’s a way of getting it down. You do it through a legal process. It’ll go quickly if it’s right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","51:07"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden is the candidate of these privileged liberal hypocrites who hold you and your values in disdain. But you can send them all a thundering message on election day by voting for Trump-Pence. Do we love our vice president too? Do we love our vice president? I’ll tell you, I watched Kamala last night and I said, “I’ll take Mike.” I’ll take Mike by a lot. He’s been a great vice president actually. Pennsylvania is the state that gave us the Declaration of Independence, Valley Forge, Gettysburg, and generations of American patriots. Just like you. You’re patriots. You love this country. That’s why you’re here. You’re sitting in this boiling, crazy hot, sun. But you’re smarter than me because with you it’s on the back of your head. With me, I’m going to go home and my wife is going to say, “What happened? You look like a lobster.” Look the sun. This is great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","51:50"
"Donald Trump","I want to look like Lou, nice and dark. Right Lou? But with Lou it’s a little easier I think. This is the state where workers got their hands dirty mining the coal and forging the steel that raised up the mightiest nation in the history of the world. We’re going to be stronger than ever before. Remember that. We are already. We are going to be stronger than ever before, and that’s happening right now. Proud citizens like you helped build this country, and you know this. Look, together we’re taking back our country. But I was just thinking as I said “stronger”, they want to come in and raise your taxes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","52:56"
"Donald Trump","They want to come in and put regulations on all of your factories, and all of your jobs, and all of your personal things. You know, little things, and they laugh at it when I say it. The light bulb. Those new expensive light bulbs. I said, “What happened to the old ones? They’re better.” They said, “They were mandated out.” I said, “Why?” Nobody could explain why. I said, ” We’re letting them back. The light bulbs are back.” Dishwashers. They have dishwashers they don’t give you any water. They give you not enough water, so they’re lousy. So what do people do? They press the button again, and again. No water. I let them have lots of water.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","53:39"
"Donald Trump","We just got back from Whirlpool in Ohio. They’re thriving now because of what I did to competition from other countries. I tariffed them, and Whirlpool now went from a company that was just about over to a company that’s thriving. Sink faucets, shower faucets. I won’t say the third element of the bathroom because they always just bring that up, so I won’t say that but you know what I’m talking about. They don’t allow water. You go into a new hotel. You turn on the water. There’s no water. I opened it up. I said they could have as much water.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","54:14"
"Donald Trump","I mean does Pennsylvania have a problem with water? No. Yeah you have a problem with water. You have too much of it. Right? You have too much water. You got to get rid of it. So why are we having restrictors? They have restrictors on, so I took it off. These are little things. I tell you about them. A lot of people appreciate them. A lot of people don’t know about it. But now you could go out, buy a light bulb for a tiny fraction of the cost that’s better. Won’t last as long, but it’s better. It’s better light. Makes me look much better. That’s a very important, it’s a very important thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","54:46"
"Donald Trump","But you can buy now faucets where water actually comes out, and so instead of having it like on for many times longer … Actually when I take a shower, I can have water hit my hair instead of drop, drop. It’s hard enough my hair without that. So now we can actually have water pouring out of our shower heads. Okay? So a lot of good things. We’ve done a lot of things that nobody talks about, nobody writes about, but it’s about quality of life, and I think the people really appreciate it. I really do. Not so easy to do. Not so easy to do. I don’t think anybody else could have done it. Nobody else would have thought to do things like that, but nobody else would have done it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","55:16"

Mohammad would never go down, but Larry Holmes was a great champion and I know he loved Easton. He used to tell me that, “I want to invest my money in Easton.” I don’t know if that was a good thing or a bad thing.

Together we’ll unite citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed, as one people, one family, one glorious nation under God. That’s another word they don’t want you to say, God.

We’re all that stands, and a typical Republican probably wouldn’t get there but I think I’m very Republican in many ways, but your typical Republican would not be able to win.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","57:22"

It’s a great area. These are great people. They’re great, hardworking, incredible people, and we love them.

It’s going to be very interesting to see how he does, and I hope he does well. I’ll be honest. I do. I hope he does well. I really hope he does well, but I also want him to tell the truth. He’s got to tell the truth about things, and he’s going to do a lot better if he does, but hopefully not well enough. Right now we are leading a war that’s incredible. But right now we’re leading in so many polls that they refuse to put out. We’re doing so good in this state, in North Carolina, in Florida, in Texas, in Ohio, in Michigan. You know how many car plants are being built or expanded in Michigan? We’re doing fantastically in Michigan. We’re doing great in New Hampshire.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","58:35"
"Donald Trump","These are real polls. These aren’t suppression polls. These aren’t polls where they do registered voters. Registered. No. You want to do voters that are going to vote. Registered voters. You want to do what’s called likely voters. Likely. In other words, people that are likely to vote. Not registered voters, many of whom have died, many of whom aren’t going to vote, and then you want to do an even count. You don’t want to do many more Democrats. They do a poll. Right? Many, many Democrats, few, few Republicans. Trump is down by six, and then you look and you say, “Well, if that poll is true, we’re up by 10.” So we’re going to see. You’re going to see. They did it last time. They had me losing every swing state. I think they had me losing like nine states that I won. But he’s going to lose. Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","59:26"
"Donald Trump","You were the first one that told me Lou. He’s going to lose seven swing states. He’s going to lose them all. He’s down by 14. Washington Post-ABC, they had me down one week before the election 12 to 14 points. The day of the election, because we complained that it was a fake poll, so they changed it the day of the election, and they had us just about even. Remember that whole big deal? We said, “You can’t say we’re down because that’s called suppression.” Then you say, “Hey, I love Trump, but I can’t vote for him because I don’t have the time because he’s not going to win.” But if you would have gone out and voted, we would have won. The problem was last time for them, 2016, everybody went out and voted. There was no suppression. There was incredible exhilaration except on the other side that they would not … You ever see those pictures of the craziness going on? But the polls were fake. Just like their stories are fake. Just like the news is fake.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-20-in-joe-bidens-hometown","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 20: In Joe Biden’s Hometown","01:00:11"
"Donald Trump","The polls are even worse, and we’re now actually doing worse. One of the most accurate polls was Rasmussen, and Rasmussen came out today. Did you see it? 51 for Trump, 51. I think they were one of the three most accurate polls and the ones that are telling the truth. Sometimes, I mean they have a poll that came out recently that was very favorable, they refused to release it. They didn’t want the people to see it. What kind of stuff is this? That’s why you’re going to do a great job. Right? You’re going to make sure this stuff doesn’t happen, but we’re going to make sure too. So we’re going to win this, and I think we’re going to win it really big.

"Donald Trump","It looks like a hundred. Right? You can multiply it times a hundred, but when you see this crowd, and when you see the kind of enthusiasm, there’s nothing like it. We’re leading by the way, even they admit, we’re leading by enthusiasm by numbers like they’ve never seen before, record numbers. Meaning we have record enthusiasm, and he has a record lack of enthusiasm, and that is a big, big factor. So I just want to thank all of the people from this incredible place. I mean it’s just a great, a great, great place. I’ve been here for so long and so much, and I love it, and I love the people. We’re going to have the biggest victory. We’re going to have a victory that will equal or surpass what we did in 2016. Thank you all very much. Thank you very much.
