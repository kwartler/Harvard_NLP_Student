"President Donald Trump","Thank you. So as we begin Labor Day weekend, America’s unprecedented economic recovery continues. You see what’s going on. It’s been pretty amazing. The United States economy added today, announced this morning, 1.4 million jobs last month, bringing the total to over 10.6 million jobs created in just four months. That’s a record by far. In August, we added 249,000 retail jobs, 174,000 leisure and hospitality jobs, and 29,000 new manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate plummeted to 8.4%, the second largest single month drop ever recorded, surpassed only by our big decline in June. Last month, we saw large declines in the unemployment rate for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. Very big declines. We’re witnessing the fastest labor market recovery from any economic crisis in history, by far. By contrast, the last administration had the slowest, weakest, and worst recovery in American history. That was well-documented, as you know.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","00:00"
"President Donald Trump","This year, the United States has seen the smallest economic contraction of any major western nation. And we are recovering at a much faster rate than any other nation business. Business confidence is higher today in America than in any other G7 or EU country. That covers a lot of territory. So we have the business confidence is higher than many in any of those countries. In July retail sales, not only recovered, but reached a new all time high. So think of that. Retail sales, that’s a very basic statistic, and it’s a big statistic. It not only recovered, but reach the highest level ever. Auto sales have surged to an incredible 74% since their April low and are nearly back to their pre-virus levels. And that’s been a tremendous thing. Used cars and new cars have been both doing incredibly well. Mortgage applications with 27% higher in August. Then during the same period last year, home builder sentiment reached the highest level on record indicating that more high paying construction jobs are on the way. Home building has been great and lending has been really incredible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","01:21"
"President Donald Trump","US manufacturing activity reached a 19 month high in August. While my administration has fought every day to restore prosperity, however, Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats in Congress are holding additional China virus relief hostage to reasons that nobody understands. I guess I do. I think I understand, it’s called politics. And speaking of politics, I think North Carolina, I think that Michigan and Pennsylvania and other states, they should open the governor’s, the Democrat governors should open the states. They’ll open them on November 4th, but they should open them now. It’s very unfair to the people to have those shutdowns continuing at the level that they continuing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","02:41"
"President Donald Trump","Democrats are insisting on a massive taxpayer bailout of badly run blue states, stimulus checks for illegal aliens, and the mass release of inmates from jail. They want to release a lot of inmates, some of them for very serious reasons. They want to release them from jail. They want that as part of a stimulus package. Can you believe it? It’s time for the Democrats in Congress to start working across the aisle and put the American people first. Now, we have $300 million in an account that we didn’t use. $300 million, and we are willing to use that. I would be willing to release it subject to Congress and use that as stimulus money. And it would go right to the American people. So we have $300 billion sitting in an account that we didn’t need because things are going so well with the economy, but it would be a very appropriate thing to release that to the American people. And I am willing to do it. All we need is a sign off, but that doesn’t mean that we’re going to release prisoners. Some prisoners, some very vicious people, actually.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","03:25"
"President Donald Trump","We’re not going to put them on the streets like the Democrats want us to, and we’re not going to give stimulus checks to illegal aliens. They came into the country illegally, and now we give them a check. We want to give the checks to the American people. So remember we have $300 million, it’s there. We don’t need the money. We don’t need anything. Just let that money get released to the American people. As our economy rebounds, there’s only one thing that could stop the extraordinary economic comeback and wipe out the future of American workers, and that’s what the Democrats want to do with a $4 trillion tax hike, implementing things that will be really bad for our country. And this will just absolutely cripple what we’re doing on regulations and so many other elements of success. We had the greatest economy in history prior to the China virus coming in.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","04:39"
"President Donald Trump","Now, they want to stop regulations. They want to bring up regulations to a level stop. The things that we’re doing, which are at a much smaller level and bring up regulations at a level that nobody’s ever seen before. They want to do things that will make it impossible for any economy to grow. They want to ban fracking. And as you saw ban ban ban, and all of a sudden he sees his polls going down. And now he says, “Well, I was only talking about not maybe banning fracking,” but he wants to ban fracking. And it doesn’t matter what he wants to ban. The people that control him want to ban fracking. And whether it’s Pennsylvania, Texas, Oklahoma, North Dakota, so many other states, you can’t ban fracking. That would be a disaster. Ohio.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","05:34"
"President Donald Trump","Want to abolish America and energy. I mean, that’s, what’s going to happen. Adopt disastrous trade deals and inflict a devastating shutdown. As you know, he said “We want to shut it down.” And we would be willing to shut it down. And you don’t shut down when we’re setting records. And by the way, we’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner on the virus. Joe Biden’s blanket shutdown would collapse our economy would cause countless deaths from suicide, drug, alcohol abuse, heart disease, and more. Shutdowns cause a lot of problems, a lot of very serious problems, more so than the virus itself. Biden’s plan is not a solution, it’s a virtual surrender. And our country is doing so well. We’re starting to do so well. I think we’re going to have a great third quarter. I mean, you’re going to see it for yourself because the numbers will be announced sometime prior to the election on November 3rd.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","06:21"
"President Donald Trump","And as you know, Joe spent his entire career sending American jobs to China and other far, far away countries. For 47 years, people were pillaging our country, taking our jobs, taking our companies. And that’s never going to change with that mindset and with that group. Biden is not going to be standing up to these foreign countries, he’s not going to be standing up, maybe more importantly, to the people that run the Democrat party. He doesn’t have the strength to do that. He refuses even to condemn Antifa, a bad group, a far left domestic terrorist organization. He doesn’t want to say anything bad about it. His plan to appease the domestic terrorists is the exact opposite of what I’m doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","07:17"
"President Donald Trump","I think you saw that last night, yesterday, the US Marshals, we sent them in, US Marshals. We were waiting for a local government to take care of it, but they didn’t do that. So the US Marshals went in law enforcement, they took down the Antifa member who murdered a man in the middle of a street in Portland. The suspect was killed after drawing a weapon when officers attempted to take them into custody. They wanted to take him into US Marshals. Incredible people. So I want to thank them for their strength, their bravery, and I really do wish that the mayor of Portland and the governor of Oregon would get going and stop the crime in that city. Be so easy to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","08:06"
"President Donald Trump","While we’re focused on creating good paying jobs, the radical left has focused on unleashing really violent mobs. And you see that whether you’re conservative or liberal, Republican, Democrat, or Independent, we must all agree the need for peace and order and safety. Under my administration, law enforcement is conducting arrests nationwide of rioters, looters, and domestic terrorists. The reasons we didn’t put Chicago into our list, while we’re holding back funds from some of these states and cities that are doing such a poor job, such an incompetent job, a job that nobody can even imagine how bad. And we’re holding it back until they get their act together, and we are having a lot of people in Chicago right now, and you notice that their numbers are going down rapidly, but we’ve deployed a lot of federal law enforcement inside of Chicago. And they’re taking out quite a few people and they’re being arrested. They’re being put in jail. And that’s way you see those numbers going down, that’s why you see that with respect to the mayor, we did not hold back funds in Chicago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","08:56"
"President Donald Trump","But New York is experiencing a tremendous crime wave, in some cases up over 300%, and they have to do something quickly. We just spoke to Mayor Bowser and she’s willing to do whatever’s necessary. And we had very good talk with her. That’s in DC, and the other places they speak for themselves. We’re working with the state and local authorities to comb through hours of video tape, identify and arrest suspects and prosecute lawbreakers. We’ve already got over 300 in jail and we have tremendous evidence, and I want to thank the media for helping us out because they’re taking different angles. We have it from every different angle. You can’t probably have any better than what we’ve got. We see it from the sky, and the ground, and from the right and from the left. So when they say they didn’t do it, we say, “Well, what’s this?” So we get that from the media free of charge.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","10:04"
"President Donald Trump","Under Operation Legend, we’ve surged federal law enforcement to cities plagued by violent crime. The initiative has already resulted in tremendous success. And nationwide, we have over 2000 arrests, and we don’t talk about it too much, but now we might as well. So we’ve arrested over 2000 criminals, they’re criminals. And in a single month, the murder rate in Chicago, as you know, and as I said, it was cut in half, actually. So on the China virus front, the nations of Europe have experienced a 38% greater excess mortality than the United States. 38% more greater excess mortality than the United States. A lot of you don’t want to report that. And if we took New York out of the equation, there’s nobody even close. The job we’ve done is incredible and we don’t get any credit for it, but we’ve done an incredible job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","11:03"
"President Donald Trump","Through Operation Warp Speed, we have three vaccines in the final stage of clinical trials. Yesterday, Pfizer announced, I just spoke to the head of Pfizer, great guy. They announced that it expects to have the results of its trial very, very shortly next month. But very shortly, we remain on track to deliver a vaccine before the end of the year and maybe even before November 1st. We think we can probably have it sometime during the month of October. And Pfizer is among the leaders, as you know, and it’s a great company. Johnson and Johnson also doing well. Moderna. We have some really great companies. They’re all doing very well. They’re all in final stages. And I think you’re going to see results that are shockingly good. Finally, I want to provide you with a brief update of the virus cases in the United States have declined 28%…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","12:06"
"President Donald Trump","… of the virus, cases in the United States have declined 28% nationwide over the last month. And hospitalizations and deaths have continued to decline over the past week, very substantially declined. Thanks to America’s medical genius, the mortality rate has been reduced by 85% in April, mortality rate reduced by 85%. Hospital length of stay are one third of their average length in April, so the hospitalization is down, the length of stay is way down. In order to keep making progress against the virus, we ask all Americans to remain vigilant especially over Labor Day. We have the Labor Day weekend coming upon us immediately, I guess we can say pretty immediately, and we need everybody to be careful, to apply common sense, and do all of the things that we’ve told you to do as quickly, as much as you can, social distancing, wearing a mask whenever the distancing is not possible, and staying with a group that you know.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","13:03"
"President Donald Trump","Let’s just try and get through this one weekend, and I think we have a chance of doing that, just social distance, wash your hands, all of the hygiene, things that we speak about, and we’re really rounding the turn. And the vaccines are coming, the therapeutics have already come but they continue to come. The convalescent plasma has had a tremendous impact already, you see what’s happening there, and remdesivir has been incredible. So we have a lot of things happening. We have a lot of therapeutics coming out, I think, from the standpoint of common sense, I guess therapeutics to me right now you going into a hospital you give somebody a shot or a transfusion, it might be a transfusion, probably more than 50% are actually transfusions, and they’ll leave the hospital shortly thereafter. I mean, to me that’s more important in a certain sense then the vaccine, but the vaccines will be great over the long term, the therapeutics over the short term. And also knowing you have the therapeutics, I think is great from the standpoint of the mind, that’s great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","14:12"
"President Donald Trump","So, I want to thank everybody for being here. I’m going to ask Larry Kudlow to give a couple of examples of how strong our economy is recovering, how strongly it’s recovering, and it’s setting records at every level, and we’re doing better than every other country, and we’re very proud of all of the people for doing such an incredible job, this is a V, it’s a super V. Again, we have $300 billion ready to go, all Congress has to do is say, use it. If they say use it, I’d like to use it without their permission, but I guess I’m not allowed to do that, I did ask that question. So, Congress has to just say use it, all they have to do is say use it, $300 billion gets immediately put into our system and will really help the American people. There’s nothing else to do, just a very quick statement. So I’m going to ask Larry to come up. I want to thank another man for being here today, there’s a man that’s a incredible leader, Lou Holtz. I’ve known him for a long time, he’s been a friend of mine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","15:20"
"President Donald Trump","And I think I’ve received letters from every football coach, almost in the nation, that’s a little exaggeration, but some of the greats, Nick Saban wrote a letter, and Coach O. And Coach O as central casting, I said we’re going to have to put him in a movie, right? As a football coach. He’d really be good playing a football coach like you. And Urban Meyer wrote a beautiful letter, and so many of the other great legendary coaches, not only coaches though, people in sports and people in life and even great political people, recommending Lou for the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And we’ve analyzed it very closely, we’ve looked at all of those recommendations, we’ve looked at Lou’s life and his career and what he’s done for charity, and the football is obvious, he was a great coach, but what he’s done beyond even coaching. So, Lou will be getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom. And the date is being picked it won’t be in the too distant future. Lou is married to a great woman, right, Lou? Great woman, and she just passed away a few months ago as an incredible woman. I knew her well, she was stronger than Lou. I think she was stronger than you, Lou.

"Larry","Thank you, sir. Thanks, sir, appreciate it again. Coach, many, many congrats. Just to underscore the president’s assessment of the economy, very strong jobs report today, 8.4% unemployment rate, 1.4 million payrolls increase. But, I want to add 3.8 million increase in the important household survey, which aims at small businesses, particularly, and from which the unemployment is calculated. In the past four months, we’ve generated a 10.6 million increase in payrolls out of 14 million increase in households, so we’ve basically half of the jobs that were lost in the pandemic contraction. Today’s report also included the lower wage industries and minority groups across the board, the diffusion index was a whopping 69%, so these gains are very, very broad-based. There’s still too many people out, there’s still too much hardships, still too for many unemployed, and we are working on that and we’re moving in the right direction. And that’s why today’s numbers are encouraging and optimistic. Now, other areas that the president mentioned just to underscore. We are in a housing boom, there can be no disagreement about that. Sales, mortgage applications, prices, home starts of 23% annually in July. We’re in a car boom, automobile boom, we’ve gone from 8.7 million in sales to 15.2 million in sales in the recent four months, it’s a big jump. As the president mentioned, the leading indicator that is used, car sales and prices. The manufacturing indexes are very strong, this recovery includes manufacturing. The ISM is running in the high 50’s, the New Order Indexes at 68, production index is at 63. We had a manufacturing report for core durables over the past three months, orders up 35%, shipments up 35%. So, these are very strong numbers. New business applications from 25,000 to 66,000, it’s 160% gain through August. And as the president referred, consumer spending is booming, we’re up 84% annually over the past three months.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","18:09"
"Larry","My view, of course, we are in a V-shaped recovery, it is a self-sustaining recovery, high demand, increased production and manufacturing along with a decline in inventories will give us a tremendous momentum going into the second half of the year. I still reckon that the third quarter will be at least 20% growth. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow index is close to 30%, I think 20% is a good number, I think, the whole second half and next year provided that economic policies remain pro-growth. And I just want to mention one thing on the policy front, I simply don’t understand the other side wanting a $4 trillion tax increase after a deep pandemic contraction. And on this point, I believe vast majority of economists, I don’t care if you’re a Keynesian, demand-side or supply-sider, you just don’t raise taxes by this amount or by any amount really, but 4 trillion, really picking the pockets of taxpayers who are returning to work now and need all the resources they can get, you just don’t do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","20:46"
"Larry","The profession should be, have a complete consensus on that. And so, I’m quite surprised, and I think that is a potential obstacle and people are beginning to speak about that. But all I can say is, factually, the numbers are coming in very positively, there’s a lot of optimism going on, more work to be done. But, we’re rolling in the right direction, Chief. Thank you, appreciate it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","21:55"

There’s a theory that I can do it without the approval, but I’d rather get the approval so that we have it, but there’s a theory I could take the 300 billion, it’s money that we have, money that we built up, and money that we haven’t spent, and I would love to give it to the American people as a very powerful stimulus. So, yeah. I think there is a theory that I could do it without having to go back, but I think it would be appropriate to go back and I would ask Congress to approve it. It’s a very simple approval, literally, it’s a one sentence approval, and the Democrats should do that, the Republicans will do that, they’d be glad to do that.

It’s a great honor to get it from Delaware law enforcement.

In the meantime, we’ve got along with them, we didn’t get to war. Everyone said that if I was elected, I’d be at war in one week, it’s been just the opposite.

And we’ll be having other countries announcing soon they’re joining that, and you’re going to have a lot of countries in that. A lot of countries are saying, “Hey, why didn’t you bring us in right from the beginning?” They would have loved to have been there, but they want to be in. So, we’re doing a lot of things. I think that I was the one that alerted the United States and the world, Nord Stream 2, I said, “Why is Germany spending billions and billions of dollars…”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","25:23"
"President Donald Trump","I said, “Why is Germany spending billions and billions of dollars to Russia to get their energy from Russia?” And then we’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia. What’s that all about? And the sanctions and everything else at the same time. With Russia, we’re right now negotiating a nuclear nonproliferation treaty, which is very important. It’s a very important thing. To me, it’s the most important thing. Some people say global warming. I don’t. I say this is far more important. And we are the biggest, they are the second, biggest nuclear-wise. China’s third. They’re actually a distant third, but they’re building pretty rapidly. And at some point, we’ll include China into those talks, but we’re doing very well with Russia on nuclear nonproliferation. So I don’t know exactly what happened. I think it’s tragic. It’s terrible, it shouldn’t happen. We haven’t had any proof yet, but I will take a look.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","26:03"
"President Donald Trump","It is interesting that everybody’s always mentioning Russia. And I don’t mind you mentioning Russia, but I think probably China at this point is a nation that you should be talking about much more so than Russia, because the things that China is doing are far worse if you take a look at what’s happening with the world. Look at what happened with the China virus. Look at what they did by not keeping that within the confines of China. They should’ve kept it in the confines of China. Look what they’ve done to 188 countries all over the world. But you never ask about China. You’re always asking about Russia. So I would be very angry if that’s the case. And we’ll take a look at the numbers and the documents, because we’re going to be sent a lot of documents over the next few days.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","26:58"

Nothing easy, nothing easy, but he’s doing a very good job. I mean, while we’re at it, we’re talking about China and India, going at it pretty good on the border as you know. It’s been very nasty. It’s been a very nasty situation, and we stand ready to help with respect to China and India. If we can do anything, we would love to get involved and help.

And the prime minister could not have been more generous. We have great support from India. We have great support from Prime Minister Modi, and I would think that the Indian people would be voting for Trump. I also, as you know, went to India just prior to the pandemic setting in, because India has been hit very hard. Left, really, about a week before that. And we had an incredible time.

"President Donald Trump","No, I don’t. I don’t. I hear Germany has made it definitive, or almost definitive, but we have not seen it ourselves, no. But we have not seen it ourselves, but I would certainly be okay with that. They want to do something. They want to take action. Shouldn’t happen, but again, we are working very closely with a lot of countries and a lot of different things. We’ve taken stronger action against Russia than any other country in the world, as you know. I’ll tell you, President Putin would tell you that right now. But the fact that I get along with Russia and that I get along, frankly, with everybody right now… I’m not getting along with China, but that’s my choice. I don’t like what happened with respect to the pandemic, with respect to the China virus.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","30:41"
"President Donald Trump","I don’t like it at all. What they’ve done to this world and this country and Europe and every place else is terrible. But I do get along with President Putin, but I’ve been tougher on Russia than anybody else by far. If you look at the Obama administration, they were weak. Look at the land they gave up. Look at what happened with respect to Ukraine. Such a big part of Ukraine given up during the Obama administration, and I don’t think they would have done that with me. I don’t think they would’ve done that with me at all. We gave tank busters and they gave pillows. Do you ever hear that expression? They sent pillows and we sent tank busters to Ukraine. But with that being said, if we can do a nuclear nonproliferation agreement, that would be a great thing. No, but I would not be at all happy if that were the case. And it looks like it might very well be the case. I mean, based on what Germany is saying, that seems to be the case.

Back in 2015, you said that you didn’t think John McCain was a hero, that you prefer people who don’t get captured. In light of all that’s happened since then and all you’ve learned, do you regret saying that? Is that something you wish you had not said?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","32:35"
"President Donald Trump","I say what I say, and I never got along with John McCain. I disagreed with John McCain. You know that better than anybody, frankly. I wasn’t a fan. I disagreed with many of his views. I disagreed with his views on these ridiculous, endless wars. I disagreed with the way he handled the vets, the VA. The VA is running much better now, and we did with the MISSION Act and the accountability and all the things we’ve done for the VA. He was not able to do that. But I disagreed with John McCain on a lot of things. That doesn’t mean I don’t respect him. I respected him, but I really disagreed with him on a lot of things, and I think I was right. I think time has proven me right to a large extent.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","32:56"

"Speaker 4","And you said that yesterday as well, and I think everybody would love to see the pandemic come to an end. There’s no doubt about that. But I wanted to ask you about a forecast that has come out from the IHNE at the University of Washington, and they are forecasting by January the 1st of next year that we’ll have 410,000 American deaths from coronavirus, which is 225,000 from where we are right now. So, can you explain how you see us rounding the corner based upon that projection?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","33:54"
"President Donald Trump","If I didn’t close up our country, if I didn’t stop China, highly infected, from coming in, if I didn’t stop Europe from coming in far sooner than anybody else, including Dr. Fauci and others wanted to… And Dr. Fauci was very nice. He said, “President Trump made a great decision.” We would have far more than that. But maybe even more importantly, if I didn’t close up, we would have, instead of the number that you mentioned or whatever it may be, at 180, we would have perhaps 1 and a half or 2 million deaths right now if I went a different direction, which some people wanted me to do, and I decided not to do it. We’d have 2 million deaths. Now, a lot of countries don’t report their deaths. Obviously, China’s not reporting because they had far more than we did. China had far more deaths than we did, in my opinion. It’s just my opinion, but they don’t report their deaths or they don’t report them accurately.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","34:28"
"President Donald Trump","And I don’t want to embarrass other countries, but I can tell you, there are other countries where the death toll is far higher than the United States, but they don’t report deaths. We report it to a level that nobody reports it. We also do testing and cases. I watch your broadcasts and read your information, your media outlet very, very carefully. And I look at the word “cases” and the reason… I say it a hundred times, nobody wants to pick it up. But we do testing at a level that nobody ever dreamed possible. We have the best tests and we have by far the most tests. Actually India, as per your question before, India is number two. And they’ve done a good job, but they’re about 40 million tests behind us. And they’re a country of 1.5 billion people. Now, because of all these tests, we have far more cases.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","35:21"
"President Donald Trump","If we cut our cases in half, if we cut our testing in half, we’d probably have about half the number of cases. If we cut it down to levels… There are some countries that don’t test. They test when somebody walks into a hospital. That’s the test you get. They walk into a hospital, they’re sick, that’s your test. We have tested more and better. And you just see where we now have millions of tests coming in from a certain company that’s done a fantastic job, and it’s going to be anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 minutes on the spot, very accurate test. But if we had much less testing, no testing, you wouldn’t be reporting cases. But you saw the… I don’t want to go over the statistics. You all wrote it down, but you see how we’re doing compared to the rest of the world. And if you took out in New York, which has been a tragic situation with the amount of people that died in New York-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","36:14"

But if you took out New York from those numbers, you can multiply our tremendous success by a lot. But look, the bottom line is that the job we’ve done on COVID-19 or the China virus, China plague… Call it whatever you want, and a lot of different names, but it’s been incredible.

You know that, and so do I. You take a look at some of the things happening in certain other very large countries. First of all, we’re a very large country. But you take a look at things happening with respect to the reporting of deaths in other countries, and I say, “Give me a break.” So it’s been amazing, but we made some moves at the beginning.

But the biggest of all was closing it down, understanding the-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","38:19"

He was unable to handle the pressure of this job. This job was a tough job. Mark Meadows doing a great job, but Kelly was unable to do that. And as far as that day, I mean, we have so much proof as to going to the … I went to Paris and the environs and I was all set to go. They had a rainstorm, the likes of which you rarely see.

And I said, “Nope, I want to go. I insist on going.” It would have taken us forever. The Paris police said, “Please, you can’t do this.” They’d have to shut down various parts of Paris. And it just was not a possible situation. The helicopter would have been very quick. They had the helicopter all set, but the helicopter could never fly in that kind of weather.

"President Donald Trump","I love those people. I’ve gotten them pay raises when they didn’t get anything near what I’ve been able to do. And I’ve rebuilt $2.5 trillion. I’ve rebuilt the United States military. Now we’re including Space Force. Nobody’s done more for them. And then when I have to have a report read like that from a third rate magazine, that’s not going to be in business much longer. I look at that and I think it’s a disgrace. And then when I watch Biden getting asked questions that are really meant for a child to answer, anybody could answer. And I look at the level of question that you people ask. I mean, honestly, it’s disgraceful. So I want to thank you all very much. We appreciate it. And we’re doing very well. We’re very, very proud of what’s happened with respect to the economy. And I think that before the election, you’re going to see a third quarter announced.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","46:44"
"President Donald Trump","The third quarter will be at a level that our country has never seen before. Next year, we’ll go going to have a year that was better than last year. And I feel very certain. It will be better than last year. It’ll be the greatest year we’ve had. And the whole reason this is working out this way is because we set a foundation for this country like we’ve never had before. So next year is going to be a fantastic year. But remember this, the third quarter is going to be announced sometime prior to the election by a few days, actually. And I think it’s going to be record setting type numbers on GDP and other things. Thank you all very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-press-conference-transcript-september-4-addresses-alleged-fallen-soldier-remarks","Donald Trump Press Conference Transcript September 4: Addresses Alleged Fallen Soldier Remarks","47:39"
