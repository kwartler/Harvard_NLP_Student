"President Trump","A long time to be independent, and as long as I’m your president, we will never let anyone put American energy out of business, which is what they’d like to do. We will never again be relying on hostile foreign suppliers. We will defend your jobs and we will defend the Lone Star State, I love this state. We will defend Americans who found energy independence. Before going any further I want to provide you with a brief update on our battle against the China virus.

Earlier this week, a promising vaccine entered the final stage of clinical trials long ahead of schedule, with more following very quickly behind.

"President Trump","Under the last administration, America’s energy industry was under relentless and unceasing attack, you know that. But the day I took the oath of office, we ended the war on American energy and we stopped the far left assault on American energy workers. Now the assault, you’ve seen what’s going on. It could come again. But I have a very strong feeling you’re not going to have to worry about it. If you do you’re in big, big trouble.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","14:09"
"President Trump","I withdrew from the one-sided, energy destroying Paris Climate Accord. It was a disaster. It cost us billions of dollars and it would have made us a noncompetitive nation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","14:40"
"President Trump","We canceled the Obama administration’s job crushing clean power plan. You know all about that. I improved the Keystone XL and the Dakota Access Pipeline immediately upon assuming office. We opened up ANWR in Alaska to energy exploration, ended the moratorium on coal leasing on federal lands and reopened public lands and offshore areas to oil and gas exploration. That’s where David Bernhardt’s done such a great job. Thanks David. We unlocked the full energy potential of Texas and New Mexico, and New Mexico, we’re proud that we’ve been here. We’re proud to help. You have been fantastic. A lot of jobs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","14:54"
"President Trump","Since my election oil and gas production in the Permian Basin has more than doubled. Under the Trump Administration the United States has increased oil production by 3.1 million barrels per day. That’s some number, never been anything like that number. For the first time in nearly 70 years, we have become a net energy exporter, and the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas on the face of the earth.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","15:41"
"President Trump","To ensure we maintain this dominant position long into the future, we will never lose this position, my administration is announcing today that export authorizations for American liquified natural gas can now be extended through the year 2050. Mr. Governor is that long enough? Okay, 2050, that seems like a long time. He said let’s make it longer.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","16:20"
"President Trump","At the same time, we’re strongly protecting our environment. Air pollution is down significantly since I took office. While other countries are polluting the world’s air and oceans, we will never cease to be a leader in protecting our natural environment and that’s what’s happening. People don’t know that about us. We love our environment. Under my administration the United States will continue to have among the cleanest air and cleanest water anywhere on earth and that’s what we have.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","16:54"
"President Trump","Thanks to our pro- American energy policies, we’re also taking jobs in factories away from countries with poor environmental standards, such as China, and bringing jobs back to America, where they belong. Before the invisible enemy struck our shores, we created 800,000 new energy jobs, a third of them in Texas. That was just the new jobs. Add onto that millions of other jobs. After the China virus struck we implemented historic economic relief. When oil crashed, I got Saudi Arabia, Russia and others to cut nearly ten million barrels a day and got OPEC plus and Mexico to agree to the deal and hence we’re okay. Now we’re back. We’re back. I will tell you, and I can tell you that I spoke with Dan and Greg and I spoke with Senator Ted Cruz, I spoke with a lot of people and we were very close to losing a very powerful, great industry, and we did a job. We did a great job all together, working together, a job like I think nobody could have done, and now we’re back and now we’re just going to keep expanding.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","17:29"
"President Trump","You will see. It’s happening, but we really did. We did a great job and I want to thank, frankly, Saudi Arabia. I want to thank Russia. I want to thank Mexico, and I want to thank OPEC as they call it, Plus. It’s called OPEC Plus. That’s OPEC, Plus a lot of other countries. But they all came to together and they did a job for the industry and we appreciate everybody’s help.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","18:48"
"President Trump","This action stabilized world oil prices that had been in a free fall and saved millions of energy jobs, and frankly it saved your industry. Four months ago people were very, very concerned about that industry, and now it’s just going to be a question of how fast will you put people on.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","19:12"
"President Trump","Through the Paycheck Protection Program we provided over one billion dollars in emergency aid to keep Texas energy workers on the payroll. We kept them all in the payroll. We opened up 30 million barrels of space in Strategic Petroleum Reserve, allowing American companies to store surplus oil to be sold at a later time, and we filled up our 75 million barrels in the Strategic Reserve.

"President Trump","I only wish he bought it when the oil was selling for zero and they paid you $37.00 in addition. You get a barrel plus $37.00, I said, “Dan, why didn’t you make that deal?” I would have loved that, but you did well.

"President Trump","Today I’m taking another bold action to support energy jobs in Texas. In a few moments, I will sign four critical permits granting approval to vital pipeline and railway infrastructure on our nation’s border. That’s a big deal, this will include two permits allowing the export of Texas crude to Mexico, a giant victory for the workers of this state that you’ve been after for many years, right? You’ve been after that one for many years. I said, “What do I know about it? If you want to do it, it’s okay with me,” and we’re doing it, so that’s been a long time in the making.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","20:24"

Josh [inaudible 00:21:15] was born and raised right here in Odessa and Midland, where’s Josh? Thank you Josh. After spending a few years away at school, Josh came back home to West Texas. Josh’s dad worked on the oil rigs. Josh worked on the oil rigs and he hopes his three children will work one day doing the same kind of incredible work and looking for the wonderful opportunities in American energy. Josh, thank you very much. Congratulate your family. You’re going to have a great future. Thank you.

Did you make the right move, Brian? I think so, right? Better believe it. With over 25 years of experience, Brian, a senior pumper with Double Eagle Energy, do they treat you well? They better, they better, I’m going to come back and see those two guys. Just like thousands of other veterans who work in this industry, Brian has made America safer with his service and now he’s helping keep us secure by maintaining American energy independence which we have. Thank you very much Brian. Great job. To Brian and every veteran who works in the American energy sector, we salute your noble service and we thank you very much, we thank you very much, everybody, thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","21:51"
"President Trump","While my administration is fighting for workers like you, the radical left, have you ever heard of the radical left, Brian? You don’t want to hear about them. You don’t want to know about them, is fighting to abolish American energy, destroy the oil and gas industries and wipe out your jobs. Washington Democrats have embraced Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s nearly $100 trillion Green New Deal disaster. I have added the fourth word, it’s a disaster, which would ban oil and gas leasing on all federal lands and by the way there would be no fracking, so let me ask you Mr. Governor, how do you think that works in Texas? No fracking, no drilling, no oil, is that okay? Good. I don’t think Biden’s going to do too well in Texas. He’s already written it off, it’s gone. No fracking, that’s part of his platform. If these far left politicians ever get into power, they will demolish not only your industry but the entire U.S. economy. Their stated agenda includes rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, spending billions and billions of dollars in order to make us non-competitive, and seeking an even higher level of restrictions mandating net zero carbon emissions which frankly is impossible, for all new homes, offices and buildings by 2030, not possible to do, and if you ever did it, it would cost so much that your home would be valueless.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","22:50"
"President Trump","This would cause the cost of construction to skyrocket and effectively end the use of natural gas in homes because it would be an impossible situation. They’re asking for things, just so you understand, that are impossible. I don’t know, I haven’t checked recently, what have they done with cows? Remember there were going to be no more cows and no more cattle. I think they might have left that one off the manifesto but it will be back. Their platform calls for mandating zero carbon emissions from power plants by 2035. In other words, no drilling, no fracking, no coal, no shale, no gas, no oil. Otherwise they’ve been very good to the industry I think. You got to be careful. People don’t take it seriously. If they got in, you will have no more energy coming out of the great state of Texas, out of New Mexico, out of anywhere. Oklahoma, North Dakota, name them. Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania does a lot. People don’t realize that, a lot. It would throw Pennsylvania, Ohio, so many other places, you don’t realize how big it is, they want to have no fracking, no nothing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","24:25"
"President Trump","The policies required to implement this extreme agenda would mean the death of American prosperity and the end of the American middle class. It would mean I think even worse than that. It would destroy our country. I used to say we would become another Venezuela, same ideology, you would become another Venezuela. Venezuela used to be one of the richest in the world per capita and period one of the richest in the world, among the largest oil reserves. Now they don’t have water, they don’t have medicine, they don’t have food, you got a lot of oil, it doesn’t matter. Doesn’t seem to matter. They don’t have anything, and that can happen to us. All you have to do is look at Portland, look at the agitators, look at the anarchists in Portland and our people have done a great job in protecting our courthouse and I told my people a little while ago, if they don’t solve that problem locally very soon, we’re going to send in the National Guard and get it solved very quickly just like we did in Minneapolis and just like we will do in other places. They want to solve their problem, they’ve got a very short time to do it, but they’ll either solve their problem or we send in the National Guard.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","25:39"
"President Trump","The U.S. energy industry would grind to a halt and every single energy producing state would be plunged into a depression. Two million jobs would vanish overnight in just the state of Texas alone, and I think the number’s probably Greg a lot higher than two million. Millions more would disappear in New Mexico and Ohio and Colorado and Pennsylvania. By imposing these punishing restrictions and beyond restrictions, the Washington radical left crazy Democrats would also send countless American jobs, factories, industries to China and to other foreign polluting states. They want us to take care of our air but China doesn’t take care of its air. In all fairness, India doesn’t take care of its air. Russia doesn’t take care of its air, but we do. Not on my watch it’s not going to happen I can tell you that. Because as long as I’m president, we will always put America first. It’s very simple, very simple. For years and years we put other countries first. We now put America first.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","26:57"
"President Trump","As we have seen in cities and towns across our nation, it’s not just Texas oil that the radical Democrats want to destroy, they want to destroy our country. These people are sick. They are sick and you better get used to hearing it because they have some real problems. They don’t love our country. In any way, shape or form, they don’t love our country. There’s no respect for the American way of life. There is no way of life ever in history that’s been like the great American way of life. There’s no respect but there is by you and there is by 95% of our people. Our people love our country and our people love our anthem and they love our flag. Remember that. The radical left wants to tear down everything in its way and in its place they want power for themselves, they want power. Hard to believe, power. They want to uproot and demolish every American value. They want to wipe away every trace of religion from national life. They want to indoctrinate our children, defund our police, abolish the suburbs, incite riots, and leave every city at the mercy of the radical left. That’s not going to happen. That’s not going to happen. By the way, I just ended the rule on suburbs. You know the suburbs, people fight all of their lives to get into the suburbs and have a beautiful home. There will be no more low income housing forced in to the suburbs. I abandoned and took away and just rescinded the rule. It’s been going on for years, I’ve seen conflict for years. It’s been hell for suburbia.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speaks-at-midland-oil-rig-transcript-july-29-signs-pipeline-permits","Donald Trump Speech Transcript at Midland Oil Rig July 29: Signs Pipeline Permits","28:13"

You know that generations of Texas oil workers before you gave every last bit of sweat and heart and grit that they had to build up this country. They loved our country. They loved our country so much they couldn’t breathe.

Ted Cruz, John Cornyn, and our Senate and our House approved $2.5 trillion to rebuild entirely the United States military. It’s now at a point that it’s the strongest it’s ever been. A lot of the equipment is still coming in, brand new planes and missiles and everything you can think of. And I want to thank you, Ted. You were one of the real leaders, and John too. The two of you, I appreciate it very much. You are well-represented. We have the greatest equipment on earth. We have equipment that I can’t even tell you about.

And I just want to finish by saying that I’ve had a great relationship with your leaders, with your politicians. With all the people in Texas, we’ve had great success. We had a great victory.
