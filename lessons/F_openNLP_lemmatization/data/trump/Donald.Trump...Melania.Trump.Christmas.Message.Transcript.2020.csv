"Donald Trump","During the sacred season, Christians celebrate the greatest miracle in human history. More than 2,000 years ago, God sent his only begotten son to be with us. An angel announced the birth of our lord and savior to humble shepherds. He said, “I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all of the people. Today in the town of David, a savior has been born to you. He is the Messiah, the Lord. You will find a baby wrapped in clothes and lying in a manger.” At Christmas, we thank God for sending us his son to bring peace to our souls and joy to the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-melania-trump-christmas-message-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Melania Trump Christmas Message Transcript 2020","00:05"

Students have delivered groceries to elderly neighbors. Communities have found new ways to stay connected to one another. Courageous first responders, doctors, and nurses have given everything to save lives. Brilliant scientists have developed treatments and vaccines.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-melania-trump-christmas-message-transcript-2020","Donald Trump & Melania Trump Christmas Message Transcript 2020","00:48"
