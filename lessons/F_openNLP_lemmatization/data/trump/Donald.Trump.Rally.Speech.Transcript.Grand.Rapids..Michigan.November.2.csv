It is great to be back in the Great Lakes State, just 80 minutes from election day when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","00:00"

It is really great to be with y’all and a special treat tonight to be with my much better half, she’s a military mom, she’s been committed to helping our military families, been my wife for 35 years.

"Vice President Mike Pence","But we’re here tonight for the same reason you are. For one reason and one reason only. And that is that Michigan and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House. It’s on, and the road to victory goes straight through Michigan.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:43"
"Vice President Mike Pence","You all are great to be out tonight. And you know, I got to tell you, I just spoke to the President. He just finished up in Wisconsin, but he can’t wait to get to Grand Rapids. It’s great to be back here tonight. We’ll never forget. We’ll never forget being in Grand Rapids four years ago tonight. The clock ticked past midnight. It was election day 2016. The President spoke until about 1:30 in the morning and he walked up to me after he walked off the stage, he looked out at the crowd just like this one and he slapped me on the shoulder and said, “Mike, I don’t know about you, but that doesn’t look like second place.” And it still doesn’t. Michigan did it before and I know Michigan’s going to do it again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","02:09"

And it’s also great to be here with some great leaders who served alongside with us every step of the way. Would you join me in thanking two of the most principled conservative leaders in Congress? Two men have been with us every step of the way.

"Vice President Mike Pence","And how about the next Congressman from the third congressional district, Peter Meijer? and earlier tonight, the President and I were with a friend of mine, got to know him over the last couple of years. He’s a man of integrity, dedicated to his family. He’s a West Point graduate, a combat veteran, a businessman, and the next Senator from the great State of Michigan, John James. Four years ago, we inherited a military that had been hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy that was struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression, terrorism was on the rise around the world, and we witnessed a steady assault on our most cherished values. But in three short years, we rebuilt our military, we revived our economy, we secured our border, supported law enforcement and stood for life, liberty and the Constitution of the United States. Incredible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","03:56"

"Vice President Mike Pence","That’s why it’s astonishing in the midst of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by $4 trillion. On Friday, his running mate, Kamala Harris said, quote, the first order of business is to get rid of the President’s tax cuts. They got a $2 trillion version of the Green New Deal, but under President Donald Trump, where they’re planning to raise your taxes, we cut taxes across the board.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","06:31"
"Vice President Mike Pence","We rolled back more federal regulation than any administration in history. We fought for free and fair trade, unleashed American energy, and in three short years, businesses created 7 million good paying jobs, including 112,000 jobs right here in the Great Lakes State. Unemployment reached a 50 year low, and wages were rising across the board in those first three years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","07:15"
"Vice President Mike Pence","And they were rising most rapidly for hardworking, blue collar Americans. The forgotten men and women of America were forgotten no more. When Joe Biden was Vice President, America actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. I come from just south of here in Indiana, just like Michigan, we do two things well out this way, don’t we? We make things and we grow things, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","07:46"
"Vice President Mike Pence","The last President actually said, after losing 200,000 manufacturing jobs, he said, “They’re never coming back.” Remember he said, “What magic wand do you have?” Well, we didn’t need a magic wand. We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","08:19"
"Vice President Mike Pence","500,000 manufacturing jobs in just three years. So manufacturing came roaring back and when it comes to trade so important here in Michigan, what we make and what we grow, we sell to the world. Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader of communist China, all along the way while they took advantage of the United States, put barriers to their markets while we put none to ours.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","08:39"
"Vice President Mike Pence","And closer to home, when it came to our trading relationship with Canada and Mexico, Joe Biden liked to complain a lot about NAFTA, but he never lifted a finger to fix what was wrong with it when we saw thousands of factories closed and jobs shipped south of the border. But under President Donald Trump, we put China on notice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","09:12"
"Vice President Mike Pence","We said the era of economic surrender is over. We stood strong, imposed tariffs, and NAFTA is now gone. And the USMCA is here to stay. And it’s something you ought to know about Joe Biden’s running mate as well. I had a little debate with Kamala Harris in Salt Lake city a couple of weeks ago. Thank you. Some people think we did all right. So… thank you. But you all deserve to know in this hard working State of Michigan, despite the fact that USMCA was a huge win for Michigan, right, Bill?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","09:34"
"Vice President Mike Pence","I mean, Kamala Harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the USMCA. Kamala Harris said the USMCA didn’t go far enough on climate change. I mean, she put her radical environmental agenda ahead of Michigan jobs and Michigan workers. No wonder she was listed as the most liberal member of the United States Senate last year. But when it comes to trade or anything else for that matter, I promise you, President Donald Trump will always put American jobs and American workers first. And on energy, Joe Biden wants to crush American energy under a $2 trillion Green New Deal that would raise the cost of electricity for every home in business in America. It’s true. The President had to remind him he was for it in that first Presidential debate, remember? But he is, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","10:18"
"Vice President Mike Pence","And Kamala Harris, she was the original co-sponsor in the Senate of the Green New Deal. The truth is Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to abolish fossil fuels, end fracking. It would destroy hundreds of thousands of good paying jobs. They said it over the last year, over and over again, but now, right, Joe Biden shows up in Pittsburgh. I wasn’t far from there today. And he’s trying to convince people that he’s not for banning fracking. He actually said that our President was lying about it. It came up in the Presidential debate. How good did President Trump do in that Presidential debate? Wasn’t that a great night? That ball is still going.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","11:22"
"Vice President Mike Pence","Anyway, it came up in the Presidential debate. Remember Joe Biden, about 90 minutes into the debate, he said, “America needs to make a transition from the oil industry.” I love what the President said. He said, “That’s a big statement.” But by the next morning, Joe Biden was already denying, but [inaudible 00:12:32] even in the debate, remember? He said, “Show the tape.” So we’ve been showing the tape.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","12:09"
"Vice President Mike Pence","I got to tell you, men and women of Michigan, look, no matter what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are saying right now, you can take it to the bank. Joe Biden and the radical left are going to abolish fossil fuels, ban fracking, close down the oil industry if they ever get to the White House, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to have more fracking, more American energy and energy independence for generations to come with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","12:45"

"Vice President Mike Pence","Folks, the choice we face in this election, I really believe it’s a choice between a Trump boom and a Biden depression. I mean, there was an independent review of his plans last week. Said that Joe Biden’s economic policies would cost this country 5 million jobs and cut the average income of the Americans by household by $6,500 a year. So anyway, every minute between now and when the polls close tomorrow here in Michigan, if you come across a family member or a coworker or a neighbor that is still undecided, I want you to say I was out at the airport, ran into Mike and he said if I ran into anybody who was undecided, I was just supposed to ask him one question. Seriously. Just look them in the eye and say everything I, just everything else. Just look them in the eye and say, “Who do you really think can bring this economy all the way back?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","13:34"

A career politician who spent 47 years in Washington, DC raising taxes, growing government, waving a white flag on international trade or a proven job creator who’s overseeing the fastest economic recovery in us history? You ask them. If they’re honest, they’ll answer. So this election really is about prosperity. It’s about jobs, about our children’s future, but it’s also about national security. And I’ll tell you what, I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. You might not know the Pences are actually a military family. My son’s a United States Marine. My daughter is married to a Navy pilot who’s currently deployed. And we couldn’t be more proud of them. In fact, my daughter is a military spouse, and while her husband is away, she’s out campaigning a little bit with mom and dad. Would you welcome my wonderful daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond?

"Vice President Mike Pence","When Joe Biden was Vice President, America saw years of scandal at the VA that shocked the conscience of the nation. You remember.

And when it comes to law and order, you all know President Donald Trump has stood every day with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement and we always will. The President and I know what you know. Men and women who serve in law enforcement are some of the best people in this country and they deserve the respect of every American every day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","18:20"

Well, I got news for the Democrats in Washington and their Hollywood friends. That Dogma lives loudly in me. That Dogma lives loudly in you.

When you pray, pray with confidence in these challenging times where it seems like there’s more that divides us than any time in my lifetime, we ought to claim those ancient words that have seen Americans through much more challenging times than we could possibly imagine. The words of an ancient promise that say, if his people who are called by his name will humble themselves and pray and turn that he’ll do like he’s always done in the long and storied history of this great nation, he’ll hear from heaven and he’ll heal this land. This one nation under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all. So pray for America. Pray for all the American people.

So we’re going to see how that all works out. We’re going to see how that. But that’s another reason we want to go for a long time, frankly. Because you know what? We started something incredible. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. We then had to close it down for a period of time. We saved millions of lives. Remember the original estimate was 2.2 million people would die from the China plague, and they could have kept it in China. They didn’t get infected in the rest of China after Wuhan Province. But it came out to the world, it came out to Europe and the United States and 188 countries all over the world.

It may be a safety problem, but it shouldn’t take 20 years, it shouldn’t take 19 years, 21 years.

And he never had what it took. He was a glad hander. Not a smart guy. Not a nice guy, either. By the way, not a nice guy. But he was, I used to call him 1% Joe, because he ran for president all the time and he never got more than 1%. Now he’s got half the intelligence he had 20 years ago and he wins.

Here’s his line. “Ladies and gentlemen, we are going to give you the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. It will be $4 trillion.” They’re going to increase your taxes by $4 trillion. $4 trillion tax increase. That’s his campaign, and they’re going to put the money in the Green New Deal, which is conceived and designated by AOC plus three, right? AOC plus … This was their deal.

What’s so bad? Tell me what’s so bad.” And at the end of the evening, “He’s done very well with women. What happened?” No. But this time we’re going to do even better, because we are providing safety and security. And for the suburban women, I mean, we’re saving the suburbs.

So you’ll be happy that I just signed on the plane, that’s beautiful Air Force One, and it is a beauty, I have to admit an executive order to teach our nation students pro-American values. That will be taught. Sleepy joe Biden has vowed to abolish and eradicate the American oil and natural gas industries, and he’s pledged to ban fracking. And you saw that. For a year, more than that, he’d get on stage with all these crazy people, radical left people, and they were screaming who could ban it faster. He would say, “Yes, I’d been fracking. I am totally against fracking.” For a year, “I am against fracking.” I could play 100 clips. See the board? Where is the board. I spent a lot of money for that today. He’s going, for a year, “I am against fracking.” Then he lucks out because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren doesn’t get out, so she takes votes away from crazy Bernie, right? On Super Tuesday.

We can’t let the sleepy guy fool us, though, because he happens to be a corrupt politician, and they don’t want to write it.

Kill all the birds.” Joe Biden is a globalist who spent 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders, and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that most of you have never even heard of, okay? A vote for Biden is a vote to eradicate your auto industry. Somehow I don’t think you want to do that in your particular state. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA, one of the worst trade deals ever made, and now we have USMCA, which is a great deal. What a difference. No, you were sending all your jobs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:54:16"
"Donald Trump","You know, 12 years ago, I was honored, believe it or not, the Man of the Year, and I was never thinking about doing this, the Man of the Year in Michigan. I’m still trying to figure out how that happened, and I got up and I said, “You know, you’re losing all your car business to Mexico, and Canada, too, by the way, and what are you doing? Why are you doing it?” And it was a whole big thing, became quite controversial as usual. But I was right, and it was probably the biggest reason that I ultimately ran for the presidency, because I saw how we were being ripped off. Not only the auto business, how we were being ripped off by every country of the world, friend and foe, on trade. And it just was something that was terrible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:55:08"
"Donald Trump","Now with the USMCA, they said there’s no way I would ever pull it off. “There’s no way you get rid of NAFTA.” You know why? Because Mexico and Canada loved it. I said, “Well, if they love it, that means it can’t be any good, right?” They said, “Sh, we never thought of that one.” So I wouldn’t say they’re exactly thrilled with USMCA, but we’re fine with it. We like it. But he was sending your auto jobs, so many of them, to Mexico, and it was terrible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:55:50"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden supported China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which was the beginning of a disaster. It was good for China, but it was sure as hell bad for us. But you know, we won seven and a half billion dollars a little while ago, because we wouldn’t win anything. They had no respect for this country whatsoever, and now they know that if they don’t treat us right, we’ll pull out of that deal so fast. Now all of a sudden we’re winning all these cases, but we just won seven and a half billion dollars, which would have been impossible with a different president. You are so lucky I’ve agreed to be your president. Go out and vote for Trump.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:56:16"
"Donald Trump","The seven and a half billion dollars we won, that was nice. Michigan lost half of all of its auto manufacturing jobs, because that was like a Biden and his friends, that was a betrayal to you and to many other states. He supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have eliminated your auto industry totally. I came in and immediately canceled it. I canceled it. I was so happy to cancel the TPP. I ended the NAFTA disaster. Canceled that one too. I’ve been an activist. Despite the fact that every week I’m being hit on all different sides, ” Let’s impeach him for having a perfect conversation with the President of Ukraine.” They were the ones that had the bad conversations, including his son making $183,000 a month to sit on the board of a company. His son. Where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? His first name is, “Where.” Where’s Hunter? Remember that? I brought that up. A t-shirt was made overnight. It was the hottest selling t-shirt of the year. “Where’s Hunter?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:56:56"
"Donald Trump","You know where Hunter is? He’s buying vacuum cleaners, because he follows his father and he vacuums in money from every country that his father sees. No, seriously, Ukraine. His father was a judge of Russia, Ukraine, and China. President Obama entrusted him with those three countries. Those are the three beauties, right? Russia, Ukraine. So Russia, Moscow, the mayor of Moscow, his wife gives him three and a half million dollars, Hunter. Now he got dismissed from the military, was unemployed. His father becomes Vice President, and now all of a sudden he’s raking in money like you never saw. Now you tell me, is that honest? And then they say the big guy gets 10%. The big guy in some cases gets 50%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:57:59"
"Donald Trump","And then the last one is he asked China for $10 million here. This is Biden. They asked for $10 million, yeah, $10 million for introductory purposes. That’s what … Introductory purposes. So he’s going to introduce people to who? To his father, for which he gets $10 million a year. I never saw anything like this. And the fake news refuses to report it, because they don’t want it in there, because it’s not good for them. How about the Moscow? Three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Three and a half million dollars to, “Where’s Hunter?” You know, ” Where’s Hunter?” He’s at the bank depositing his money.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:58:48"
"Donald Trump","Now think of it. So he gets a billion and a half from China. He goes with his father on Air Force Two, a plane that the great Vice President Mike Pence uses too. Mike, do your kids follow you to the various countries, raking in money? No. He’s got the greatest people, the greatest children, the greatest family. I don’t think they have, right, where they’re flying airplanes for our military. No they don’t. They do it a little differently. They do it the old fashioned way. No. Mike Pence, it’s a holder. I always compare … I say, “Can you imagine with Mike Pence?” How good we have it with Mike Pence compared to that. No, it’s great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","01:59:36"
"Donald Trump","How about the China, though? So the kid has no investment experience whatsoever. His father and him, they go into Air Force Two. In 10 minutes, like a 10-minute meeting, he walks out with a billion and a half dollars from China. They don’t do this for the biggest investment firms. I spoke to a friend of mine who’s one of the biggest guys on Wall Street. He said, “No, this is never done. They invest their own money. They don’t need people that are much dumber than them to invest their money. They invest their own money. They don’t do that.” Then he said, “Wow. That’s amazing. How long did it take him to get the money?” “About 10 minutes.” Walks out with a billion and a half dollars to invest, which is millions of dollars a year.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","02:00:22"

They have me trending every day on Twitter, Twitter Trending. They make up these stories, phony stores. They put up stories or they’ll take an old story, make it as bad. “Number one trend,” like some really boring story. Trending is like, you got to be cool, right? To trend. I’m trending number one, number two, number three. Everyone, “Negative, negative, negative.” How the hell did I ever win this thing? It’s such a fix with these people. I’m always trending with these stories that are like, either they didn’t happen, or they make them different. And I don’t want to act like a complainer, but it’s a totally rigged deal. And everyone said four years ago, they said, “Sir, you can’t win.” “Why?” “Because big tech is against you.” I said, “What’s big tech?” I didn’t even know what the hell it was, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","02:01:01"

If I didn’t have … They say, “Don’t tweet.” Forget the tweet. It’s called social media. If we didn’t have social media, I’d have no voice. We wouldn’t be here. I have no choice. They say, “Gee, we wish she wouldn’t do so much tweeting.” I don’t do tweeting. What I do is social media. And without it, I don’t think we’d be here, because we’d have no voice. There’s no voice with these people. They’re dishonest people, mostly. Not in all cases, but Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who, what he’s done is he’s bled America dry.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","02:01:52"

And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because, thank you, I’m not a politician. Thank you very much. If I don’t always play by the rules of Washington and the Washington establishment, it’s because it was elected to fight for you, and I fight for you harder than anyone has ever fought for you before. Joe Biden is bought and paid for by big tech, big media, and powerful special interests. That’s why he takes in $300 million. They taken millions and millions of dollars for his crazy campaign, and he’s not going to win.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-grand-rapids-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Grand Rapids, Michigan November 2","02:02:34"

Thousands in Iowa. We’re winning an Iowa very big, by the way, just in case. Thousands of tractors in Iowa on big farms, thousands and thousands. They have thousands of boats, 6,000 boats out in the lake, out in the ocean. They have things nobody’s ever seen anything like it. So I think we’re going to have a very big day, but they say you can’t win without big tech. Well, we’re going to find out tomorrow. Wouldn’t that be wonderful? But they said the same thing, they said the same thing four years ago. The head of CNN said, “You can’t win without CNN.” I said, “Really?” And we won, so now we have to do it again.

I mean, just take a look. These people, what they do and what they get away with, and I guess that’s the other reason. I mean, I was in politics and I see what’s been happening to our country.

We have a great American dream. We’re not going to let it happen. We’re not going to let that happen. We’re going to keep our great American dream.

You’re not allowed to meet and you’re not allowed to pray together, but you’re allowed to protest, so I call everything that we do a protest.
