Wow, thank you very much Tucson, I’m thrilled to be in Arizona with the thousands of loyal, hardworking American patriots, 15 days from now, we’re going to win the state of Arizona And we are going to win four more years in that beautiful White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","04:13"
"Donald Trump","Everybody needs to get out and vote, return your absentee ballot or vert. You know, you can go out there, I think today, when do you do it, today? Tomorrow? Whatever. You can go out and vote today, they say. Today, go out and vote. That beats a ballot. Do you agree, that beats a ballot? Remember the old fashioned days when you’d actually go out and vote, today they send you millions of ballots. Are you okay over there? Everyone fine. Good. Okay. He looks better than I do, that guy. He looks better than I do. Good. Thank you. You make sure you’re okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","04:58"
"Donald Trump","With your vote, we’ll continue to cut your taxes and regulations, maintain energy independence, which we have now. Strengthen our military support, our police, protect our Second Amendment. I don’t know, I don’t see you people, I don’t think you’re going to want to give up those guns, I don’t think so. That’s that’s not for Arizona. Defend our borders, arrest violent criminals and confirm more judges to uphold the rule of law. Under my leadership prosperity will surge. What we’ve done in the last three and a half years has been incredible. Nobody’s ever done what we’ve done. There is no administration that’s accomplished what we’ve accomplished in the first three and a half years. Not even close. Optimism will boom, the pandemic, it’s rounding the turn, vaccines are coming and I look fine, don’t I? And we’ll get back to a normal life. That’s what we want, just a normal, just seven months ago, we want to get back. It will be better than that, very soon. We built a foundation that’s so strong and you see what’s happening? Stock market through the roof, your 401k’s through the roof, you stocks through the roof, your housing through the roof, everything is good. Your optimism. And what about 56% of the people? Just a Gallup poll, just came out, 56% of the people say they’re better off today than they were four years ago and we have a pandemic. And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country, that’s what’s going to happen. We’re cutting your taxes, they’re raising your taxes. That’s an easy one to figure out, isn’t it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","05:34"
"Donald Trump","This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery or a Biden depression, if he even gets to run. It’s a choice between getting a safe vaccine and getting back in and working. And by the way, you have a governor here today, he’s done a great job and he’s kept you open. You’re open. Unlike some of them like Michigan, we won the case in Michigan. The only one that was allowed to have a good time was the governor’s husband. He was allowed to do whatever the hell he wanted, but nobody else, they were like in a prison. But we’re going to have a safe vaccine and Biden, you know what he’s going to do? Lock them down. Let’s lock everybody down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","07:33"
"Donald Trump","But we built the greatest economy ever. We had to close it down, we saved millions of lives by doing what we did. Then we built it back up and now we’re doing record type numbers. And it’s a choice between the American dream or a socialist nightmare, that’s what it is. Biden will delay therapies, postponed the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools and shut down our country. And we’re opening and we’re opening rapidly. And we’ve got a V-shape. It may be a super V. It looks like it’s a super V, which nobody ever even heard of before. He will massively raise your taxes, you will be buried in regulations.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","08:16"
"Donald Trump","We cut regulations, it would take 18 to 21 years to get a highway approved. We have it down to one year. And you know what? From two to one will very shortly to be exact, right now it’s less than two would have it down to one year and it may get rejected for environmental reasons of safety and that’s okay. Probably not, but that’s okay, but you know what? You’re going to have it approved or not approved and it’s a one-year process, not a 21-year process. And this has gone on all over the country. And in my opinion, what we’ve done on regulations, is even more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. I think it’s more important. And they’re going to bring all those regulations back. They want to dismantle your police department, dissolve your borders.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","08:58"
"Donald Trump","Dissolve your borders. If you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country. Confiscate your guns, ban American energy, wipe out private healthcare, 180 million people terminate religious liberty. This is for the women, the women who live in the suburbs, they want to destroy your suburbs. And I ended the rule that was going to destroy. I ended the regulation that was going to … I kept hearing that women from the suburbs, won’t like Trump. I said, “Why? Because I’m stopping crime?” You’re going to have suburbs be safe. Suburbs, you’re having safe suburbs. And you’re not going to have low-income housing projects built next to your house. We ended the regulation that would have destroyed your suburbs. It’s amazing how the women like me, all of a sudden.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","09:47"
"Donald Trump","As you know, the Democrats, they want to cut our military to the bone. And we built the greatest military right now in the history of our country, frankly, in the history of the world. Biden will surrender your jobs to China. He wants to render your future to the virus and he will surrender your country to the radical socialist left, and you see that happening. The only thing Biden wants to do, is get as much as he can for himself. Have you been watching this whole thing play out? I didn’t know anything about it. Oh, here’s a picture of Biden playing golf with these men. “I didn’t know my son was taken money from [Barisma 00:00:11:24]. I didn’t know my son got three and a half billion dollars from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, I wonder why.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","10:42"
"Donald Trump","And then, you see all the things, right? That we have to give the man 10%. We have to give the man 10%, right? Boy. I’ll tell you what, nobody’s ever seen. And the media, right? And big tech, they won’t allow it. Charlie Kirk, you know Charlie Kirk, great guy? They shut down his site because he mentioned it. Look, he’s a corrupt politician this guy, he’s a corrupt politician. To get the power, Biden has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s domination. He has handed control of his party over to the socialists, the communists, the Marxists and the left wing extremists. And that’s before we get to his own personal corruption, which is more than anybody in history. I say this, it’s the second biggest scandal politically in the history of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","11:33"
"Donald Trump","Number one, was spying on my campaign and getting caught. Biden even chose as his running mate, the most liberal senator in America, Kamala, Kamala. Senator Kamala Harris, is a sponsor of the socialist green new deal and legislation to strip away the private health plans of 180 million Americans. And, her and Bernie Sanders want to do something in Arizona, they have some deal in Arizona where your taxes are going to go way up. You know that right? Your governor, who’s right over here, you’re great governor was saying, he’s not happy with it. But Bernie Sanders, the second most liberal person, she’s first, right? She’s considered first. They want to raise your taxes eight and a half percent. So I’m glad … Right, governor? He’s saying more. It’s probably more. What is the name of that governor, rural what? Right? You know about it. Okay, you can’t have them in, because they control Biden a 100%. Biden is shot. You know, he’s shot, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","12:39"
"Donald Trump","He’s gonzo. Harris also urged their supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the rioters, the ones that knocked out your towns, your cities. Not in Republican areas, by the way, all in Democrat areas. You look at Portland, we would have taken 15-minutes, we could have solved that. We told the governor, Democrat, “Let us in, we’ll solve that problem.” We went into Minneapolis, it took us a half an hour, that was over with. Unfortunately, they could’ve called a little earlier. And in Seattle, they gave up when they heard we were going in the next morning. But we resolved, look, all Democrat areas, New York going to hell. I feel so sad with New York, crime is up 200, 250%, Cuomo. A terrible thing has happened in New York. Look at Chicago, Democrat again. Crime is through the roof. That a weekend, 87 people were shot and 16 died. Now, do you believe, this isn’t, “Hey, we’re in Afghanistan, you don’t lose many people.” Were coming out by the way, we’re all coming back home. But you go to war zones, you don’t have that. And we could solve it so easily.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","13:50"

"Donald Trump","Thank you. You know, there’s never been that chant before? Seriously. We all like Ronald Reagan, I guess he’d be, but he never had that chant. We love you. Thank you though. We love you. You’re going to make me cry. Don’t do that. I don’t want to cry. I don’t want to cry. You make me cry, you’ll destroy my image, and then you won’t love me anymore. That would be terrible. I appreciate it. No, I do. And I feel the same way. That’s why I’m doing this. I had a good life before I did this stuff. Believe me. My life was very simple and very nice. The Democrat party’s war on cops is inciting riots and putting police officers and American families in very grave danger. Unlike Joe Biden, I will always support the heroes of law enforcement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","15:05"
"Donald Trump","And I was endorsed by almost every law enforcement group in the United States, including New York’s finest, and Chicago, and Florida and Texas and Oklahoma, and every place. And I was just named, I have to say this happened today, the man of the year in that big magazine, the blue magazine, good name for it. Man of the year. So I just tell you that, for whatever reason I tell you that. I’m the only one standing between you and a left-wing crusade. You know, you have people, they want to change our whole country. And the thing that’s going to bring us back together is success, because I’ll tell you, we were ready. I was getting calls, seven months ago, we had the best employment numbers we ever had, we had the greatest success we’ve ever had. We were beating China at everything. You kept hearing about China, we were beating everybody. And they were calling me, people that I wouldn’t be speaking to generally, let’s get together. It was happening. And then we got hit by the China plague. And then we had to start all over again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","16:11"
"Donald Trump","Success brings us together. I saw it, and we saw it for two months. It was really going on. A new study of the Biden/Harris agenda found that their plans will crater the typical American family by more than $6,500. They’re horrible, horrible plans, to finance what? The blue? The new green deal. The green new deal is the craziest thing, right? No more airplanes, no more double cars, no more cows. If you have a ranch, you won’t have cows anymore. No more you. You’ll be next, in just three years, I increased family income by $6,000. And we’re not even talking about the energy. Did you ever think you’d be seeing $2 gasoline again? And you got that. And it’s plentiful. And we saved all our energy jobs. All of our energy jobs, we saved. Biden will eviscerate the middle-class, my policies will lift the middle class to record highs, and that’s where we’re going very quickly. For the last 47 years, Sleepy Joe Biden chipped away your jobs. Shut down your factories, threw open your borders, and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these endless ridiculous foreign wars.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","17:13"
"Donald Trump","In countries you never even heard of. Joe Biden is a servant of the left wing globalists and lobbyists, the wealthy donors, the Washington vultures, who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, they raise a lot of money, the Democrats, you know why? Because they make deals. They make deals. I would be the greatest fundraiser in history if I wanted to call Wall Street, I know them all. I want $10 million for my campaign. Yes, sir. All I have to say is I want 10 million. I went 15. I went 25. I would set every record. But you know what happens when you do that? You’re selling yourself out. When you have to do something, you can’t do it anymore, because you feel guilty. See them setting all sorts of records. I know what the records are. The records are every time they set a record, they gave away everything. In 2016, you voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first. About time. It’s about time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","18:38"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden is always and always has been a corrupt politician. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. And you know what? You knew that, and a lot of people knew it for a long time, but now you have the laptop, it’s over. It’s over. And as far as I’m concerned, the Biden family is a criminal enterprise. And that’s what it is, it’s a criminal enterprise. Smoking gun emails, Joe, and we just found them. You saw that. Did you see shifty shift? We think that the laptop was made by Russia. Oh, I see. He just said it was made by Russia. Here we go again. Russia did it. Russia, Russia, Russia. You know, the head of DNI, John Ratcliffe who’s fantastic came out and said, “That was false information.” No, these are bad people. These are sick people. Do you notice, they never say it was made by China? Because they’re all on the take. Smoking gun emails show, just came out that the Biden family used the vice presidency as a for-profit cash machine. And that Joe Biden has been lying to the American public to cover it up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","19:44"
"Donald Trump","Remember he said, “No, I never met anybody from Barisma is it? Is it Barisma?” Actually I that I understand. Because he’s got no memory left. It’s gone. Is it Barisma? No, I don’t… and then they show a picture of him playing golf with the head of Barisma. Ah, boy, oh boy. If Biden wins, China wins. And China will own the USA. Remember what I said? The media and big tech is trying to hide the entire scandal. Do you believe what they’re doing? They’re taking people like a Charlie Kirk and others off if they even mention that Biden is corrupt. And they know he’s corrupt, but he’s their corrupt. He’s so perfect for them. He’s their corrupt. Because they know that publicizing these revelations would mean an end of Biden’s presidential run. I think it’s an end right now. Look, I think it’s an end right now. How the hell could you do, when you see the kind of things that they do, where the big guy has to get at least 10%, the big guy.

And here I am all by myself. Aye yi yi. Anybody else, they would have been in a corner right now thumb in mouth saying, “Mommy, take me home, mommy. I want to go home.” No, it’s great.

They try to take away your guns while they enjoy private securities, and fully armed, by the way. How fully armed. How about Bloomberg? “We are fighting guns.” And he’s got five guys around him with guns. They support crippling lockdowns while their jobs and their industry remain totally exempt. It’s time to send a message to these wealthy liberal hypocrites in Washington and in Silicon Valley, show them the American people are in charge by delivering their chosen candidate sleepy Joe Biden, who shouldn’t even be their candidate. He should have lost because Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren, if she would’ve dropped out at the day before Super Tuesday, Joe would have lost every single state to crazy Bernie.

And we taught that lesson to him four years ago, but we’re going to teach him again, because this is the most important. I used to go, a few months ago say, “Well, I don’t know. This is important.

Who’s willing to give free healthcare to illegal immigrants? They said, to illegal immigrants. And everybody raised their hand, and Biden couldn’t get his up. Because he knew, he’s been doing this crap for 47 years. He couldn’t, he knew it was wrong, but then he looked, and his brain is shot. So he looked over there, and the hands were all up. And then he looked over there, and the hands were all up. There were a lot of them. He knew it was wrong because it would be so horrible for our country, because everyone’s going to flood our country. You get free healthcare. You get free healthcare, you get free education. I jokingly said, and everybody gets a Rolls-Royce. And CNN said, “That’s a lie.” So what happened is he couldn’t get it up, and then he looked and he looked and he got it up. And I said, “Thank you.

But he’s always complaining. And yet he was here for 47 years, I say, “Joe, Joe, it’s not like you’re an outsider.” And it wasn’t that long ago, either. 47 years, and all he does is complain. Biden had 47 years to fight for seniors and reduce prescription drug costs, and look what I’ve done. And I’ve just exercised, they’re going to come down 70, 80, 90%.

In the end, we couldn’t. They got too greedy, too much money, too much money. But you know, last year we brought drug prices down 1%. I’m not bragging about it, it’s the first time in 52 years that drug prices came down. But now we’re going for the big one. Now we’re going for the big one. And you know, rebates, the richest people, the middleman, you know the middlemen about drugs? We have middlemen. Nobody knows who the hell they are. Never hear middle women. I hear middlemen. So we’ll make it politically correct. Middlemen middle. No, they’re called middlemen. Nobody knows who they are. These guys are so rich. Who are they? I’ll bet you Hunter gets a piece of the action.

I’m taking on the powerful, special interests, like never before. Nobody’s ever done this before. Nobody’s ever done it before. I mean, for years you heard about drug prices, nobody ever did anything. And now you hear about drug prices, and they’re dropping. They’re going to be dropping like a rock. Also, I’m letting your governor, your great governor, buy, until the thing kicks in and probably litigation. But I’ve exercised this whole thing with favored nations.

For Medicare plans at less than $35 a month. People were dying because they couldn’t afford insulin. 33 million seniors, 33, think of this, $35, but 33 million seniors on Medicare will soon be receiving $200 to help with their drug costs on top of everything else.

We can’t let that happen to a president because we have to be at the top of our game. That’s why you can’t let Biden be president, because he’s not at the top of his game, mentally. We can’t have that. One thing I can tell you, Putin, president Xi of China, Kim Jong-un, all of them. Macron, they’re very much at the top of their game. You can’t let this happen to our country. You can’t.

I hear it’s going going good? Good. Thank you, Brandon. Brandon Martin. Thank you, Brandon. You’re going to do great. I heard you’re doing really well.

"Donald Trump","We did it and now we had to do it again. It’s all right. It’s happening, and it’s happening much faster. It looks like a super V. In my first three years, we increased family income more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of that. Five times more in the first three years, five times more than eight years of the Obama/Biden administration. This is not even believable. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American unemployment, Asian-American unemployment, all reached record lows, the lowest in the history of our country. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic-Americans. That’s a record. I’m doing very well in the polls with Hispanic-Americans, but I always liked you, and you always liked me. The fake news just didn’t know that. Our policies are lifting up all Americans of every income. Since the China Virus, we created 11.4 million American jobs. It’s a record too. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it. The unemployment rate, and normally I wouldn’t be happy about this, right? But the unemployment rate a week ago hit 7.8%. Think of that. Now, we were hearing 42. It’s going to go to 42. It’s going to go to 44. It’s going to go to 38. 7.8% and heading this way. Think of that. Would you believe that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","38:40"
"Donald Trump","Normally, I wouldn’t say it, because we were at 3.4, 3.5 and had even better than that, but that’s okay. We’ll be there. After the virus left China, we experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western country and the fastest recovery anywhere in the world, from an economy standpoint. We’ve already cut the unemployment rate in less than half. That’s a fantastic thing. Under Biden and Obama, it took over three and a half years for Arizona to regain 60% of the jobs lost in the crisis. We’ve done it in four months. Think of that. It wasn’t our fault. It wasn’t our fault. Manufacturing production is up 61%. Retail sales are up, excuse me, 121%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","40:14"

I have a way that we can stop it. Elect Sleepy Joe. No, no. Who has a 401k? Okay. If I told you that your 401k’s and you’re all at record highs are very close, right? If I told you that your 401k’s will be cut in half and much worse than that, that’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to end up in a depression with this guy.

They’re going to put on regulations.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-tucson-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Tucson, Arizona October 19","41:11"
"Donald Trump","Every company is going to say, “Let’s get out of here.” Because I’ll tell you, the regulation cuts, which are more than anybody, than any administration’s ever done, the regulation cuts in their own way were more important than the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. Thank you, man. As president, I’ve been delivering for our incredible Hispanic-American community, like nobody has done before. I’m fighting for school choice, safe neighborhoods and Hispanic- owned, small businesses. Joe Biden would wipe out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations. You know, he said the other day, “Oh, I’d lock it down.” Oh great. Thanks a lot, Joe. We appreciate it.

Now they come in, they come in legally. Now the wall is great. It goes down deep and it goes up high. No more tunneling. We’re bringing our jobs, our factories, our troops back home in the USA where they belong. Right? Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. Our Southern border is now, and I want to thank Mexico. Mexico has, right now, 27,000 troops guarding our border.

We gave them everything they wanted and they’re really happy, and it’s had a huge impact. We’ve got the best border that we’ve ever had. You know what? You have a big chunk of it right here, and it’s really worked. You have 200 miles, they tell me. 200 miles. 200 miles. I didn’t even know you had that. That’s a lot of mileage.

They developed a new computer, 15 minutes obsolete. The two things that will never be obsolete, a wheel and a wall. Remember the Democrats, they said, “No, we want drones. We want drones.” So you can have drones watching everybody pour into the country. No, thank you. Nope. 200 miles of wall in Arizona and you got it all. It’s all done.

Biden’s plan would eliminate U.S. borders by implementing nationwide catch, they want nationwide catch and release. You know what catch and release is? You catch them, take their name. They could be murderers, rapists, and then you release them into our country. Guess what? We don’t do that anymore. Okay? That wasn’t easy. And they want to make every community into a sanctuary city, and they want to suspend all removals of illegal alien. So what they’re doing, and this is done by crazy Bernie, right?
