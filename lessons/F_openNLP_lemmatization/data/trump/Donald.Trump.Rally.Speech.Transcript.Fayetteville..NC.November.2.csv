"President Trump","Thank you Fayetteville and North Carolina. Thank you very much. Tomorrow, we are going to win this state and we are going to win four more years in our great White House. With your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, support our fantastic military, care for our veterans, protect your second amendment, defend religious liberty and ensure more products are proudly stamped with that wonderful phrase, “Made in the USA.” Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded. 33.1% just announced last week. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. It’s a number that we never even thought possible, nobody did. Nobody thought it was possible and we’re going to now even do better than that. It’s going very rapidly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","07:55"
"President Trump","While foreign nations are in a free fall, you see what’s going on with so many nations in Europe, unfortunately. I say that with sadness. We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. A recent Gallup poll found that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago, under Obama and Biden. You got to remember that, you got to remember that kind of thing. They didn’t do a good job. In fact, if they did, I wouldn’t have runned. If they did, I wouldn’t be here right now. They did a bad job. And Obama, he went out yesterday with Biden. They got like 14 people, they didn’t have too many. They didn’t have too good a crowd and we have five of these today. Five. We have some big ones. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","09:07"

"President Trump","Thank you very much. Looking tremendous in Florida, so of course, they don’t mention that. It’s Florida. We are looking good. We’re really looking good all over in the real polls, not the Fox polls. Those Fox polls… There’s somebody at Fox who doesn’t like me very much, I can tell you. They are the phoniest polls and they were almost as bad four years ago. Actually, they were worse, but you get some of these pollsters, they work magic. And the amazing thing is, they hang onto their jobs. They do horribly. Look at what they did last… I had nine states and I had to win them all and they said I was going to lose all nine. This is four years ago. I was going to lose all night. It’s going to be very short evening for Donald Trump. And the polls said decisively, “I was going to lose all nine.” And that was the day before and I won all nine. No, I won them all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","11:26"

And you wonder what kind of a business that is? You wonder what kind. We have a case where in Wisconsin, we’re one up and I left there a couple of days ago. We had a rally, you wouldn’t believe it.

I think we’re going to win Wisconsin because we have a lot of people that say, We don’t want to talk to you,” and then they go vote for Trump. The hidden voter or whatever they call them.

ABC News, Washington Post, which is basically lobbyists, as far as I’m concerned for Amazon, it’s just a lobbyist. They didn’t say like, he’s two down, three down, four down, a fake poll. They said, “Trump is 17 points down in Wisconsin.” I could lose it. I could win it. I don’t know how I’m not, I did a lot of good things for Wisconsin, but let’s say it’s even and I call up a great pollster, John, and say, “John, let me ask you a question.” I think we’re one up in Wisconsin, but ABC, Washington Post, they did the same thing four years ago, if you remembered that, very close to the election, they said, we’re down 12.

They say, “Well, listen, we love the president, but if he can’t win…” But they did it four years ago and we complained bitterly with a very good lawyer. I had very good lawyers in those days. We complained very bitterly and they changed it right before the election. I think it was one. We’re down one. They took it from 12 to 1 in about 15 seconds. And I realized, I said, “This is a phony business,” but now they come down and it says 17 down in Wisconsin, 17.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","14:41"

I’m not 17 down. I might be one down or I might be two up, but I’m not 17 down. What’s going on? Why don’t they make it [inaudible 00:15:43] have to live after that? They have to do other events.

"President Trump","He said, “They can’t do that because they want you to lose and if you’re two or three or four, everyone’s going to go vote. They want to make sure that your people don’t vote and when you’re 17 down, people say, ‘I just can’t waste my time. I’m not going to stand on line.'” And I said, “Isn’t that sick?” And he said, “He knows some of the people and they’re very smart. They’re very brilliant. They’re smart people.” He said, “But if they made it five down or four down or six down even, so they make it something that’s so bad, 17 down.” I said, “Isn’t that a shame?

Him and his group, destroy the suburbs, dissolve your borders, terminate religious liberty, outlaw private health insurance, 180 million people have great health insurance. Shred your Second Amendment, confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with anti-American lies. Biden has vowed to abolish the American oil and natural gas industries and ban fracking. For a year and a half, he said it. Then all of a sudden he goes to Pennsylvania. “No, I never said that.” And the fake news doesn’t do anything about it.

Joe Biden is a corrupt politician who raked in millions from China while giving them your jobs. He’s a corrupt politician, you see it. Now they say the laptop Schiff, that watermelon head, Schiff. “That laptop was produced by Russia.” Here we go again, Russia. Russia, Russia. Here we go again.

He a psycho in many ways, but he knows, it’s a total con game. I had to put up with it for three years and it affects it. When you see nothing but negative television every night, every night, every night. And then they find totally no collusion after wasting $48 million, 18 people, think of it.

And then we have people that just don’t act fast. It’s just unbelievable. We have so much information. We have the whole thing, and Obama was involved and Biden was involved. They were involved, but let’s see what happens. People should move more quickly. In 2016, North Carolina voted to fire this corrupt political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician is because I’m not a politician.

Somebody gave me $20. They impeached me because they made a perfect phone call to the head of Ukraine. I never met the gentlemen. “Congratulations on your win. If you see anything corrupt, please call the attorney general of the United States.” And we have a corruption agreement with them because it’s been a very corrupt country.

And in the Senate, 52 and a half to one half, we lost a half a vote, I wonder who that could have been. But sleepy Joe Biden is bought and paid for by China. They gave the son a billion and a half dollars to manage. That means it’s going to make millions of dollars a year, but he does know anything about investment. Didn’t know anything at all about energy. He got $183,000 a month on energy. Think of that. Think of that, $183,000.

They got the money and then they were going for the big one in China. They wrote a letter to very big powerful man within the communist party. And where Hunter asked for $10 million a year, as he was going to recommend, he was going to talk. Here’s a guy didn’t have a job, got thrown out of the Navy. He got thrown out of the Navy.

The big man gets 10, then in one case, they said 50%, right? That’s more likely because he wouldn’t do it for 10. Because these people are all hangers on, losers. But that’s the story and it’s in a laptop. And now they say the laptop was made by Russia, therefore it has no credibility. Can you believe this? And so the news, outside of the New York Post, which really I hold in high esteem. They’re a hero paper and they endorsed me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","29:28"
"President Trump","I got a nice endorsement from, did you say from Pennsylvania yesterday, right? Pittsburgh Gazette. That was nice. Once I got through that first paragraph, it was phenomenal, actually. They said, “We don’t love his personality. We don’t love his tough.” I have to be tough. Look, I’ve been under investigation from before I ever became president. I have to be tough. If I were soft, I wouldn’t be here right now. And they don’t want to say that. I was under a fake investigation by a lot of fake people. Bob Mueller and his crew, the whole thing was a fake scam that should have never been started. And they knew the answer to the first day, but it took him two and a half years to put it down, no collusion, but they knew the answer the first day. So I was under investigation for the first two and a half years. Think of that. And then they say, “He’s tough.” But I’ll take it anyway. I’ll take their endorsement anyway. Because once you get over the first paragraph or two, it says all of the things we’ve done, which are incredible, which are incredible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","30:19"
"President Trump","And now we’ll have a chance to do it without the cloud. Because I had a cloud hanging over my head, whether we like it or not. And then they say, “He was tough. He fought too hard. He was somewhat crude. He was very, very nasty. His Twitter.” Now, you know what? If I didn’t have social media, I wouldn’t be here. It was the only way I could defend myself. So it was one of those things. But I just wonder, I was thinking, I asked the people on the way, if we have great people, such loyal, great people. Including a man that comes from an area not too far from here, is a good friend of these women who have been here, this is number 64 time for these incredible, beautiful, I think rich women and their husbands are in here someplace.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","31:29"
"President Trump","But they had their husbands. They were at the one last night. That was a big deal, wasn’t it? But this is number 64. I would say I, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","32:12"

"President Trump","65. Oh, there’s two more. They come from North Carolina, but we have Mark Meadows comes from North Carolina. And he has been fantastic, he’s done a great job. He’s done a great job. Where is he? He’s probably working, bump, bump, bump with a phone. He’s got two phones instead of one. And he’s not going to break it up with a hammer like Hillary did. He’s going to throw it away.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","32:21"
"President Trump","He’s done a fantastic job. And he loves this state and he loves North Carolina. And I specifically said, “I want somebody from North Carolina and give me Meadows.” Now I knew three years ago. I said, “We got to get Meadows in here.” Big tech, big media, big donors and powerful special interests are desperate for sleepy Joe to win. They want them to win. I’ll tell you who wants him to win, China. They will own our country because they own him, they control him and they know he will always be there to do their bidding. He’ll always be there. He’s a corrupt politician. I don’t care, I’ll say it. And I say it, everybody knows it’s true. Can you imagine? Big tech refuses to put anything in. They took the New York Post down for two weeks because they won’t let anyone write.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","32:51"
"President Trump","If you put out a little tweet and say that Biden is corrupt, they will knock out your whole account. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this and you notice, it is outside of what I say, it is indeed fading away. Because you can’t have a scandal if nobody writes about it. So we have the fake news not writing about it. And you have the big tech not writing. So, how can you have a scandal? Nobody’s allowed to talk. It’s called suppression. We don’t have freedom of the press. We probably haven’t had it for a long time, but we don’t have … they say, “Freedom of the press. The American way.” We have suppression by the press. That’s what it is. What beautiful words I should have done the speech this way, it would have been much more interesting.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","33:42"
"President Trump","No, but seriously, we have suppression by the press. This is not freedom. It really is, it’s the exact opposite of freedom of the press if you think about it. Every corrupt force in American life that is responsible for cruel betrayals that hurt our family and all of the people that we love, they’re supported by Biden and they donate to Biden. I could have been a much bigger fundraiser than him, but I didn’t want to call every head of a Wall Street firm, every head of the oil companies that we’ve made rich anyway. I did a great job, we’re energy independent, that’s not so bad, first time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","34:32"
"President Trump","The failed establishment that started the disastrous foreign wars, they support sleepy Joe Biden, because they get anything they want. And he took in $300 million last month. You think he made any deals? No, I don’t think so. The career politicians that offshored your industries and decimated your factories, they support sleepy Joe. The open borders lobbyists that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs, gangs and crimes. The people that wanted to stop the wall, even though it knew it works. It’s almost finished by the way, be finished very soon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","35:12"
"President Trump","But the people that wanted to stop it, even though they knew full well, it worked. Remember they said, “No, no, we don’t want a wall. Walls are obsolete. We want drones.” Okay, good. Drones flying to watch the people pour into our country. They want drones, let’s have drones. The far left Democrats that ruined our public schools, depleted our inner cities, defunded our police and demeaned your sacred faith and values. They support sleepy, Joe Biden. You can’t even go to your churches. You can’t even go to your church and your governor of North Carolina, you got to open up your state.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","35:51"
"President Trump","You got to get your governor, I hope you’re going to vote for Dan who’s good. You got to get your state open. Don’t worry about it, on November 4th they’ll announced your state is opening. November 4th, north Carolina will be opened on November 4th. Right after the election. Because they want us to look bad. They don’t care about people. They want us to look bad. They want to try and steal an election.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","36:36"
"President Trump","The anti-American radicals defaming our noble history, our heritage, our heroes, they support sleepy Joe. Antifa and the rioters and looters and Marxists and left wing extremists, they all support Joe Biden. They always like to blame it on the right. Do you ever notice? “These were right wing.” It’s very rare. It’s rare. It’s you got bad on every side, but they always like to blame the right. It always starts off with the right, the right. This election comes down to a simple choice. Do you want to be ruled by the arrogant, corrupt, ruthless, and selfless political class? Or do you want to be governed by the American people themselves? You want to be represented by a career politician who hates you, or by an outsider who will defend-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","37:07"
"President Trump","Who hates you or by an outsider who will defend you like you have never been defended before. I didn’t need this job. I had a very nice life, but I love what we’re doing for our country. Nobody’s done so much. Nobody, no administration and I never even had a challenge on this from the fake news. Normally, if you say something slightly off, they make a big deal. No administration, president has done more in the first three and a half years then we have, our military we rebuilt, our tax cut, our regulation cuts, Space Force. It’s just a thing like Space Force. I never even talked about Space Force during the campaign. I did more than I actually talked about during the campaign. Thank you. Thank you very much. I thought this was a small little cute area. This is a small little cute area. When I came in, I’m watching Fox and a gentlemen and anchor said, “They have a small crowd of about 2000, 2,500. Nah, I knew. I knew.” It’s an incredible thing. This is a lot more than that. This is a lot of people. This is a lot more than I wanted to do because [inaudible 00:39:51]. I mean, my granddaughter is named Carolina. Do you know that? And we’ll give South Carolina some credit too. They’ve been waiting. Is that okay? I want to get your permission. South Carolina is great. They are great people too. A vote for Biden is a vote to hand the keys to government over to people who despise you and who want to rob your children of their American dream. That’s what they’re doing. A vote for Biden is a vote to give control of government over to the globalist, communist, socialist, the wealthy liberal hypocrites who want to silent, censor, cancel and punish you. If you want your children to be safe and remember this, against… I’ll put it very simply, against the second amendment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","38:03"
"President Trump","If you’re pro-life, you can forget about it. Tremendous support. Do you see these people in California? They have lines of hundreds of miles of cars and tractors in Iowa and boats, five or 6,000 boat in lakes and ocean with the flags. If you want your values to be respected, if you want to be treated with honor and dignity and respect, then I am asking for you to go out tomorrow or sooner, but I don’t know. You tend to like to vote on Election Day, right? We all do and vote. This is going to be the most important election in my opinion in the history of our country. I never thought I was going to say it. If you have told me, I was going to say that four years ago, I would’ve said you’re crazy, but it’s the most important because I’ve always said we will never be a socialist nation and that’s what they’re trying [inaudible 00:41:47].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","40:46"
"President Trump","And remember what I said. Four years ago I said, “I am your voice and we will make America great again,” and that’s what we’re doing. And if we didn’t get hit by the China plague, now we’re building it up again and we’re doing it at record clip and record numbers and at a much faster pace than any other country in the world, but we got hit by the plague from China and we will never forget it. With God is my witness, I will never let you down. For the last four years, the depraved swamp has tried everything to stop me because they know I don’t answer to them, I answer to you. Together we will defeat the corrupt establishment, we will dethrone the failed political class and we will drain the Washington swamp and we will save the American dream. This election is also a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown. He wants to have you locked down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","41:54"
"President Trump","I don’t even know if he knows to be honest. They ask him a question. I don’t think he has a clue. You can vote whoever you want, but I don’t think he has a clue. You know it, the media knows it. The media laughs behind his back and then they say, “He did brilliantly today.” No, he didn’t do brilliantly. He didn’t do brilliantly in his prime, and he’s not in his prime anymore. Or a safe vaccine that ends the pandemic and we’re doing very well with the vaccines. They’ll be distributed very soon. We will mass distribute the vaccine in just a few short weeks. It will quickly eradicate the virus and wipe out the China plague once and for all. Joe Biden is promising to delay the vaccine and turn America into a prison state. Looking again, that’s more Kamala. Remember when they said this is the Harris-Biden administration, right? I never did that with Mike. And you know what? Mike Pence never came to me and said, “Do you mind if I put my name first every once and a while?” Well, no. And by the way, he’s been a great Vice President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","43:04"
"President Trump","Some people say it was a perfect combination. It was. He’s a great guy. He’s going to be in your state in a little while. Locking you in your home while letting far left writers roam free. The Biden lockdown will mean no school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Easter, no Christmas, no 4th of July and no future for America’s youth. Other than that, it’s fine. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family and freedom to live your life, that you go and cast your ballot for President Trump. And if you remember the catastrophe. Joe Biden, he’s telling us how to run things right? This guy never ran a thing successfully. He always said horrible things about him when he was in the… Obama didn’t even want to endorse him. He wouldn’t endorse him. Even after he won, Obama said, “No way.” How long did it take him after he won? It took forever. Obama couldn’t believe it. I don’t think Obama is much better. You want to know the truth. Joe Biden personally ran the swine flu, right? The swine flu, H1N1, which he can never remember. He never says it. He says it and then goes N1H1 and I said, “No.” He failed horribly and he was a laughing stock all over Washington. They were laughing at him. And his own Chief of Staff said he was absolutely terrible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","44:17"
"President Trump","They did a terrible job. Now he’s telling us how to do it. I should have closed earlier. There’s only one problem. He’s on record all over the place, knocking me two and a half months later for closing too soon and closing it all. He said, “Don’t close.” He’s xenophobic. He’s xenophobic. I didn’t like people from China is what he’s saying. It’s so wrong. I think they’re incredible people. I do. I think they’re incredible people, but he said xenophobic. And then he runs for office. He said, “He should have closed earlier.” And you know what? The press never covers that. The only time I get it covered is if I happen to be on live television. I’ll say it again and again. And when I do say it, they try and turn it off, “Let’s go to commercial break right now. I think I know what’s coming.” These are really bad people. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said that Biden has been wrong actually on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades. He had no respect for him whatsoever.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","45:52"

He was a touchy feely person, hale and hearty, but not nice. But this is not a man that 25 years ago is not equipped to be your president. And he ran many times, numerous times. We called him 1% Joe. Think of it. And now he’s working on about 50% and he ends up winning the nomination because of Elizabeth Warren. Elizabeth Warren gave him the numb. All she had to do is drop out and he would have lost on… I mean, then we would have had crazy Bernie. But at least Bernie, they had a great energetic base.

"President Trump","For 47 years, Joe Biden, viciously, repeatedly attacked black Americans. He decimated the black middle-class and called young black men super predators. To every black American vote for Trump. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to insult you, to jail you and to betray you. I am fighting for you and got criminal justice reform, prison reform, Opportunity Zones with Tim Scott and funding for historically black colleges and universities. I got it done. Nobody else got it done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","59:59"

"President Trump","Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. Joe Biden has pledged to open borders. He’s actually talking about taking down the wall. Can you believe? “Let’s take down the wall and let everybody pour into our country.” He wants to take down. I know he said it. I don’t know. Maybe, but he did say let’s take down the wall. One of the biggest projects that we’ve ever done, you know, it’s a tremendous project. We’re up to over 400 miles. We’re going to be finished very soon. Over 400 miles. Designed to the specifications of the Border Patrol, who are great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","01:01:24"
"President Trump","Mass Amnesty wants to give them free healthcare. This is for illegal aliens and wants to keep deadly sanctuary cities. Your state has a sanctuary city. You know that, right? You have a sanctuary city, right? A very big one, actually, that doesn’t work very well. We believe our city should be sanctuaries for law abiding Americans, not criminals aliens. The Biden-Harris plan would increase refugees from terrorist nations by a staggering 700%. This has been a great term. This has been a great term. No thank you, fellas. I’m not interested. I’m keeping radical Islamic terrorists the hell out of our country. If I have the approval of North Carolina, I will keep them out. We’re going to keep them out. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military. We have the greatest equipment, greatest people. 2.5 trillion. You think that was easy to get from the Democrats? Actually the wall was even tougher. The wall was tougher but we got. Do you notice once I got the wall started and got all the funding, won all the court cases against the Democrats, the press never talks about it anymore. They don’t talk about it. We had the best statistics, the best…","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","01:02:03"
"President Trump","And can you imagine during the pandemic, because Mexico’s very heavily unfortunately infected and it was a good thing that we had it up that’s why the numbers are so good. We also passed for our great vets, VA Choice and VA Accountability. Nobody thought that could happen. We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate. We killed the leader of ISIS, al- Baghdadi is dead. Last week, I visited Fort Bragg where I presented the Presidential Unit Citation to the special forces team that achieved that historic victory. It was good. And we are keeping the name Fort Bragg, you do know that, right? Do you agree. They want cancel culture. We won two world wars out of Fort Bragg and we have other forts and we’re keeping it. We won two world wars out of Fort Bragg. And now they say, “Let’s change the name. Let’s change the name of Fort Bragg. We’ll pick somebody else. Do you have any good suggestions?” No, no. We have to keep. We have to keep. It’s our culture. It’s our heritage. So many victories, so many victories out of Fort Bragg. We also eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognize the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they tried to get it. And instead of endless war in the Middle East we’re forging peace. They are lined up to come in.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","01:03:31"
"President Trump","I said, “How did Obama and all of those that came before him do?” They told me they all used the same method. I said, “Really, I’m going to go the opposite method.” And it worked very nicely. No blood in the sand, no cost. Three very powerful countries already signed. We have many others. They’re standing on line, standing on line. And we’re bringing our troops back home. Our troops are coming back home. They’re coming back home. 19 years is enough. They serve as policemen. I said, “No, you have to get your own police department, I’m sorry.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","01:05:35"
"President Trump","A vote for me and the Republican party is a vote for the American dream. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China, which has already started. Can you imagine Biden saying we’re not going to our reliance? I mean, can you imagine? “We are going to end our reliance on you.” “Hey, hey we gave your son a billion and a half. What the hell are you telling me?” Okay, well, I don’t know, Senator, I think it would be tough for him, right? They wanted 10 million a year for his services, right? And then you say, “No, I’m not going to deal with China anymore.” Or “I’m going to be tough on China.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","01:06:20"
"President Trump","I’ve taken out many, many billions of dollars. We never did this in this country, not 25 cents. I just gave $28 billion from China to our farmers because they targeted our farmers. 28 billion and we had plenty of money left over, which went into the US Treasury. Thank you. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults for law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help, we will defend the right to life, religious liberty and free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","01:07:11"
"President Trump","We’re the envy of every country in the world. Our military now has the greatest equipment all made in the USA, but we have the greatest equipment in the world. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency and lower drug prices even more. We instituted a favored nation’s laws. We pay by far the most in the world. We are going to pay now the least in the world and nobody can believe I did it. And big pharma does not like me too much. They are not so happy with me. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman in the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-fayetteville-nc-november-2","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Fayetteville, NC November 2","01:08:09"
