"Donald Trump","Well, I just want to say hello, Pennsylvania, and hello, Montoursvile. How are you? We love this state. I’ve done a little traveling in this state today you might have heard, but we save the best for last. Right? It’s a great place. I went to school here, went to college here, and it’s a great place.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","02:41"
"Donald Trump","Three days from now, we are going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win four more great years in the White House and, with your vote, we will continue to bring back your jobs, cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great military, take care of our veterans and nobody’s done it better than we have, work with our police, our police officers, and ensure that more products are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase “Made in the USA”. It’s been a long time since you heard that kind of stuff.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","03:09"
"Donald Trump","Next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country on the assumption you don’t quadruple your taxes. Okay? It’s the only guy I’ve ever seen, his old campaign theme, “We will raise your taxes.” What the hell kind of a campaign? My whole life I’ve seen people campaign. I’ve never heard that one before, but it’s a little bit of a different kind of a campaign, wouldn’t you say?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","03:54"
"Donald Trump","Sleepy Joe Biden will shut down your economy, ship your jobs to China, where he’s very well taken care of. You never hear it from them. That’s a lot of media. You’ll never hear it from the fake media. Raise your taxes $4 trillion dollars, destroy the suburbs and we’re saving the suburbs. I hope the people of the suburbs know that. I hope the people in the suburbs know that. I ended a regulation. If they re-enact it, you won’t have suburbs anymore and send your state into a deep and crippling depression. Biden has vowed to abolish American oil and natural gas. You saw that. No fracking, no mining, no coal, no nothing. And gas prices for your beautiful large vans and cars and trucks … Some of you have trucks that you drive around in because you like that better. I think I’d be one of those. I think I’d be one of those people, but don’t you like $2 gasoline? Isn’t that nice? Well, it’ll go to $6, $7 and then you’ll be telling your family, “Let’s buy one of those little compacts that we used to buy.” Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","04:22"
"Donald Trump","Biden’s plan is an economic death sentence for Pennsylvania. He’ll outlaw fracking and what we’re going to do, we’re going to stop it. We’re going to stop it. We have a little thing up there. Where is it? Right there. That cost a lot of money to get. We get that for special … You’re going to see a little bit about fracking. But all of that great stuff, your natural gas in Pennsylvania, and they’ll obliterate and extinguish your economy as sure as you’re standing and/or sitting. Do you have chairs? Yeah, you do but everybody’s standing. That’s very nice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","05:34"
"Donald Trump","Today I signed an order and this is semi- breaking news. I did say it at the last stop, but I won’t tell you that. But today I signed an order just now on the plane to strongly protect your state’s energy and fracking industry. I just signed it. I just signed it. We have an order so that people cannot play with your fracking industry. You know, you have a million people and you are a big contributor to the rest of the country. You’re a tremendous contributor to the rest of the country. They can’t play with it. Biden said for a year, “There’ll be no fracking, no fracking.” He must have said it a hundred times. Then he lucks out because Elizabeth Warren refused to get out of the race. So Bernie … that’s the second time. Is Bernie running again, fake news? Could you tell us is Bernie … Bernie’s going to run again in four years. He’s going to get it. Actually, we thought it might be Bernie, right? More intelligence although, I don’t know, with a policy like that, I don’t call that great intelligence. Right, Congressman?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","06:09"
"Donald Trump","If Biden and Harris get in, they will terminate this executive order and implement the green new deal conceived and dedicated by AOC who probably never took a course on the environment. Do you think she ever took one little course like 101, Environment 101? I doubt it. It’ll change our whole country around. Well, it’s not going to happen. It’s so ridiculous, $100 trillion dollars, I don’t think so. A vote for Biden and Harris is a vote to ban fracking, ban mining and completely destroy Pennsylvania and it’s true, by the way. It’s not going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","07:18"
"Donald Trump","First of all, we’re going to win. You got to get out and vote. We’re going to win. A vote for me is a vote to remain energy … we’re energy independent now. Think of it. Energy independent. Our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever recorded, 33.1%, and the fake news doesn’t want to talk about it. And a friend of mine, a great financier, called up and he said, “Hey, how you doing? This is the greatest number maybe ever put out economically, GDP 33. 1. Nobody’s ever heard of it and they hardly” … He said, “I can’t believe this isn’t a much bigger story.” I said, “That’s the way it is. They don’t want that kind of thing to get out.” It’s one of the greatest numbers ever revealed in the history of our country. The second number I think was 1952 and it was less than half the 33.1. So we have not a V anymore. We have a Super V and that’s where we’re going unless somebody comes along and says, “Let’s quadruple your taxes. Let’s put all those regulations back.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","07:57"
"Donald Trump","In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. That’s another … I mean think of it, it’s never been done before and while foreign nations are in a free fall and you see that and we don’t want that, but you see what’s going on is COVID or the China virus or the China plague. There’s about 21 different names. We’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse and next year will be one of the greatest years, maybe the best year that we’ve ever had based on what’s happening. A recent Gallup poll found, just out, that 56% of Americans say they are better off today than they were four years ago with Obama and Biden.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","09:04"
"Donald Trump","And that’s rounding the turn, but that’s during a pandemic, 56%, that’s a record number, 56. You’re better off today than you were four years ago with Obama and I watched him today. They draw flies, both of them. I thought maybe they put them together. They drew a couple of horns, honk, honk, honk, and most of them are our people that are taunting. Did anybody see the picture of their crazy bus driving down the highway that’s surrounded by like hundreds of cars? And they’re all Trump flags all over the place. It’s like a hot, it’s like a hot thing. See, that’s really number one trending. They won’t put that. That’s number one, trending. They come up with number one, trending. It’s not a trend. It’s whatever they want to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","09:50"

You look at the media where they refuse to cover one of the biggest scandals, no, but the biggest scandal is we caught them spying on our campaign. Right? We caught them trying to overthrow a duly elected, commonly known as me, President of the United States. Let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens.

"Donald Trump","You’re right. Well, that you’re right. You know, there are a lot of people that call that treason. Okay. That’s treason. Let’s see what happens. If Biden gets in, the economy will collapse. Joe Biden is a diehard globalist who spent the last 47 years outsourcing your jobs, opening your borders and sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless foreign wars in countries that many of you have never even heard of. I didn’t hear of too many of them either if you want to know the truth.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","11:11"
"Donald Trump","Biden is a Washington vulture who decimated your steel mills, annihilated your coal jobs and supported every disastrous sellout trade deal for over a half a century. You know what’s happened. You know what I had to do with the dumped steel all over the place. They’re dumping steel. I put big tariffs on it. All of a sudden, the steel mills started doing good. It was a beautiful thing. And we took some of that money, $28 billion dollars we took, and we gave it to our farmers because they were targeted by China and our farmers like me. Our farmers like me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","11:43"
"Donald Trump","In fact, they just came out with the Des Moines Register poll … Did you see it? We’re way ahead in Iowa. We’re way ahead in Florida. We’re way ahead in Ohio, way ahead in Ohio. We’re doing great in Georgia. Texas, don’t even talk, they say Texas is in play. I had the same thing four years ago. Here’s a guy he’s against oil, he’s against guns and he’s against God. I don’t think that plays well in Texas. And you know where else it doesn’t play too well? In a place called Pennsylvania.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","12:16"

Same thing happened last time four years ago, “It’s too close to call.” It’s not too close to call. And then the polls close. Remember last time? The doors close, the polls close, and they say, “Texas, the doors have closed, the polls have closed in Texas. Donald Trump has won the state of Texas.” By a lot. Oh, I had many of them. I had many of them. I mean I have them now but actually they’re better now than they were four years ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","12:55"
"Donald Trump","Four years ago, it was like hopeless except for one thing. Nobody believed it and they went out and they voted and all of a sudden they took this thing. Did you see ever see The New York Times? It had a little column, “The chance of winning,” and I think it started at like 4%. And then as the evening went by and we won state after state. “Donald Trump has won the state of Florida. Donald Trump has won Georgia. Donald Trump has won South Carolina. Donald Trump has …”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","13:36"

And the chance is 15%, then it started getting into the 50s, then the 60s, and that’s where they started to go totally crazy. Remember that convention? Remember the convention hall? And then you had a couple of non-biased news anchors that started to cry. Did anybody see the debate? No, nobody, right? That last debate we had, right? Did you all… I felt like Perry Mason, because the last question, I said, “You mean you want to get rid of the oil and gas industry?” “No, we would like to transition out of it.” I said, “This is the biggest moment.” It was like… You know Perry Mason? It was always that last question, right? No, no, I didn’t do it. I didn’t. Yes, I did it. I did it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","14:03"
"Donald Trump","That was Sleepy Joe. I said, “This is the biggest moment.” And even the anchor, Kristen, she looks up at him, she goes, “Why did you say that?” Obviously being on his side, she can’t believe that he said it, but that’s because he’s not too smart. Biden was a cheerleader for NAFTA and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, which is one of the worst things that ever happened. To us. Not to China. Eliminating half of your manufacturing jobs, many of them came from right here. At every turn, Biden twisted his knife into the backs of Pennsylvania workers. And during that debate, he’d say, “Well, why didn’t you do this?” I said, “Why didn’t you do it? You just left.” “Why didn’t you do that?” “Why didn’t you do it, Joe?” That was like the easiest debate I’ve ever had.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","14:59"
"Donald Trump","While Biden was giving China your jobs, his family was raking in millions and millions of dollars from the Chinese Communist Party. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician, okay? When his son considered a board of Burisma and get $183,000 a month… Now, think of is, right? Think of this. If Biden wins, China wins. When we win, America wins. That’s what we’re here for.

Well, except in Republican cities and states, which are running beautifully without crime. Our opponents stand with the… Take a look at it. The rioters and the anarchists and the looters.

First time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate. The Chicago police, that’s not easy to do, they endorsed. We have endorsements from everybody. During the debate, I said, “Joe, what law group, any police group, anybody looking for law and order, did anybody endorse you?” He couldn’t answer the question. Then he was bailed out by the anchor, right? He was bailed out. I said, “Joe, say the words, ‘law and order.'” He wouldn’t do it. He didn’t want to lose the radical left. I’m not just running against Joe Biden. I’m running against the left-wing media, the big tech giants, the RINOs, you know what a RINO is, right? Republican-in-name-only. We got a couple of them. There aren’t too many of them left. They’re on respirators, actually. And the Washington swamp, which is much deeper and much more vicious than we ever thought even possible.

"Donald Trump","Of course, now that our United States Supreme Court has delayed everything, it’s going to be a very interesting evening. And I wonder what happens during that period of delay with the ballots. I wonder what happens. Are they going to mysteriously find more ballots, Mr. Congressmen? Are they going to find more ballots? Can you imagine what happened? Can you imagine? Just be very careful, be vigilant and watch, and report whatever you see. Because this state, we love it. Went to school here, right? Went to college. We love it. But strange things have been known to happen, especially in Philadelphia. So send them a message that they’ll never forget. This election is a choice between a Biden depression and a Trump super boom. We’re going to have a boom. We’re going to have the greatest economy ever. It’s a choice between a deadly Biden lockdown.

They have it locked down. It’s just crazy. By the way, on November 4th, he’ll announce, “Ladies and gentlemen, we’ve decided to open up.” See, he thinks he’s hurting us politically. And then we have a number like 33.1. It might’ve been 34.1, okay? I don’t think that would’ve made too much of a difference, but he’s hurting a lot of people.

Because it wasn’t their fault. It was China’s fault. And it will quickly eradicate the China virus. But with or without it, it’s going to go away, and we are rounding… It drives them crazy, the fake news media, it’s going away.

The department stores. They were saying, “Happy new year, everybody.” The snow and the red and the white, everything perfect. But they didn’t want to say Merry Christmas. I said, “You’re going to say Merry Christmas,” and now they’re all saying Merry Christmas again. We remember the party of the late great Abraham Lincoln, right? The late great Abraham Lincoln.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","44:55"
"Donald Trump","Over the next four years, in conclusion, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, our second amendment. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","45:53"
"Donald Trump","We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, already signed, January 1st goes into effect. Bigger than healthcare, you watch. Lower drug prices, even more, favored nations clause. We paid for years and years. The most expensive by far in the world. Now we’re going to pay the same as the lowest and the drug companies do not like me too much, I will tell you. They’re not a big fan of your president. They can’t even believe I did it. Favored nations. We pay the lowest price in the world, protect social security and Medicare and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. Always. Always. It’s protected.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","46:35"
"Donald Trump","America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars and NASA is now again the talk of the world. Space center, the talk to the world. It was boarded up, shut up, the runways were … they had grass growing through the cracks. It’s an amazing place. We let very rich people … They like sending up rockets. I said, “Let them set up all the rockets they want. Let them pay for it. We’ll lease them their sights and let them go out and have a lot of fun.” They’ll become a little less wealthy and that’s okay. They don’t mind, but they love sending up rockets and we’re doing things that nobody can even believe, and with Space Force, it’s so necessary so we’re very proud of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","47:19"
"Donald Trump","Mike Pence has done a fantastic job on it. Really done a fantastic job. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our school. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. We will live by the timeless words of our national motto, In God We Trust.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","48:10"
"Donald Trump","For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Pennsylvania, who I know very well. If we win in Pennsylvania, it’s over. You know that, right? Bet I’m freezing up here, I’m freezing. You better get out and vote. “Sir, you lost by just a few votes in Pennsylvania.” I say, “What the hell did I make that trip for?” They said, “We could cancel if you’d like. It’s been a long day.” I started this day very early. I said, “No, I don’t have the courage to tell these people …” Not only did we not, we’re giving you the full treatment. We’re giving you the full treatment. I could have done one of those, “Hey folks, how you doing? Everybody good? Good. I’ll see you later.” Nah, we don’t do that. But you get out there and vote because your country’s at stake. You have the power with your vote to save the American dream for your children, for your grandchildren. But you have to get out and vote. On November 3rd, we must finish the job and drain the swamp.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","48:46"
"Donald Trump","We’ve done a lot of work on it, but it’s deeper and more vicious than anybody thought. It’s more vicious. Look at what’s happening with these big tech companies. Nobody told me this stuff, but you know what? They can’t believe what we’ve done. We have come through situations. It’s amazing. Look at them. They’re sitting in there. They can’t believe … One of the reasons I also came as I wanted them to stand there all night in this freezing wind.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","50:06"
"Donald Trump","But it is an honor. I’ll tell you what. I know this part of the state and I know it and you have just incredible people. There’s no way I would have had the courage to say, “Let’s not do that. We’ll do it some other time.” There’s no way we do that stuff. We don’t do that stuff. We don’t do that stuff, especially to you. For generations America’s destiny was made, forged, and won in places like Johnstown and Pittsburgh, Erie and Altoona, Bethlehem and Montoursville. That’s a nice name.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","50:38"
"Donald Trump","Our American ancestors gave their blood, sweat, and tears to defend our country and our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, settled a continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up those great, beautiful skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world, and the best is yet to come. Best is yet to come. I mean that too. The potential we have, unless we blow it by putting people that have no clue in charge. He has no clue. He’s shot. He’s shot. Let’s face it. Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. That’s what’s happening. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working.

"Donald Trump","We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Pennsylvania, we have made America powerful again. Our military, military. We have made America wealthy again. Look at what’s happening with your 401ks. In the midst of a problem, look at those 401ks. Somebody else you would have had nothing. You would have had a piece of paper. You would have been throwing it away and it’s going up a lot. Our headwind is Joe Biden. That’s the only headwind we have to get it up. He’s a headwind, believe it or not. We have a great new name, Joe Headwind. He’s a headwind on the stock market because if he gets in the market will crash. That’s not what the market wants to hear. We’re going to quadruple taxes. We’re going to drive out every company that’s come back into this land. No, he’s a headwind. He really is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-montoursville-pa-october-31","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Montoursville, PA October 31","52:27"
