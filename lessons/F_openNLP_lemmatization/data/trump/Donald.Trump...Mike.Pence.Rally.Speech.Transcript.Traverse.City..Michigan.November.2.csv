"Mike Pence","That’s what I’m talking about. Thank you for that wonderful, warm welcome. He’s going to be here in about 40 minutes. But would you all join me in just thanking a few people. First and foremost, she’s a Marine Corps mom, she’s been a champion for military families, she’s a school teacher at a little Christian schools, she’s been my wife for 35 years. Would you join me in thanking the greatest second lady of the United States that we’ve ever had? My wife, Karen Pence. Thank you. But Karen and I are here for one reason and one reason only, and that is that Michigan and America need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","00:00"
"Mike Pence","It’s on Michigan. And the road to victory goes right through the Great Lakes state. We need the people of this freedom loving state to do just what you did in 2016. By tomorrow night, we need Michigan to show America that this is Trump country. But it really is great to be with y’all. It really is great. Also it’s great to be here with some good friends of mine under the President. In fact, one of whom is the highest ranking combat veteran ever to serve in the Congress of the United States. Now, he’s one of the strongest voices for our national defense. Join me in thanking Congressman Jack Bergman, will you? Thank you, Jack. It’s also great to be here with a man who has served the people of Michigan in the State House. And I’ve served alongside him, and I can tell you, he is one of the strongest allies of our President and our agenda in the United States Congress, Congressman John Moolenaar.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","01:06"
"Mike Pence","And let me say what a privilege it is to be here with a man that I got to know over the last couple of years. He’s a man of integrity, he’s a family man, a West Point graduate, a combat veteran, a businessman, and the next senator from the great state of Michigan, John James. Well, thank you all for being here. I know you’re out today to hear and see our President, show your support, but I also know you’re here, because of all that we accomplished together over the last four years. I mean, think about it, four years ago, we inherited a military that was hollowed out by devastating budget cuts, an economy struggling to break out of the slowest recovery since the Great Depression. Terrorism was on the rise and we witnessed a steady assault on our values.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","02:19"
"Mike Pence","But in three short years, we rebuilt our military, we revived our economy, we secured our border supported law enforcement and stood for life, liberty, and the Constitution of the United States. After Joe Biden spent the previous eight years trying to tax, and spend, and bail our way back to a growing economy, President Donald Trump created the greatest economy in American history. And we’re doing it again, Michigan! I mean, how about those new GDP numbers last week? Did you check that out? 33% growth in the third quarter. Shattered any previous record. The great American comeback is on. And with four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House, we’re going to bring this economy back bigger and better than ever before!","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","03:16"
"Mike Pence","The President said it was the biggest quarter in the history of our country, not even close. And he and I both know this American comeback is a testament to all of you, to the resilience, and the strength, and the character of the American people. But it’s also a tribute to a president and our allies in Congress who created the greatest economy the world has ever seen. That’s why it’s remarkable to think, in the midst of a global pandemic, Joe Biden wants to raise taxes by four trillion dollars. His running mate, Kamala Harris said on Friday that their “first order of business would be to get rid of President Trump’s tax cuts.” They got a two trillion dollar Green New Deal. They want to put socialized medicine in the heart of Obamacare, risk the health insurance of 180 million Americans.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","04:28"
"Mike Pence","But under President Donald Trump, in three short years, we cut taxes across the board for working families and businesses. We rolled back more federal red tape than any administration in history. We fought for free and fair trade, unleashed American energy, and businesses large and small created seven million good paying jobs, including 112,000 jobs right here in Michigan. It’s true. When Joe Biden was vice president, America actually lost 200,000 manufacturing jobs. It’s amazing. I come from south of here in Indiana, and just like Michigan, we do two things well around here. We make things and we grow things. We’re proud of it. But the last president, who I heard is out campaigning today, four years ago, he said those jobs were never coming back. He actually said, “What magic wand do you have?” Well, we didn’t need a magic wand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","05:29"
"Mike Pence","We just needed President Donald Trump in the White House. 500,000 manufacturing jobs created in just three years. And when it comes to trade, so important to what we make and what we grow. And Joe Biden’s been a cheerleader for communist China all along the way. And he never lifted a finger to reform a trade deal with Mexico and Canada, that literally costs thousands of factories to close across this country. But under President Trump, we put China on notice. We imposed tariffs and made it clear the era of economic surrender is over and NAFTA is gone, and the USMCA is here to stay. Now, Joe Biden’s running mate, I actually I had a debate with her in Salt Lake City a couple of weeks ago. Some people think we did all right. So, thank you. But I brought this up in the debate, because you deserve to know Kamala Harris was one of only 10 senators to vote against the USMCA.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","06:39"
"Mike Pence","She said it didn’t go far enough on climate change. I Kamala Harris put her radical environmental agenda ahead of Michigan jobs and Michigan workers. And I’ll make you a promise in four more years, President Trump will always put American jobs and American workers first. And I’ll tell you, it’s just as clear on energy. I mean, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris want to crush the American economy under a two trillion dollar version of the Green New Deal. Remember first debate, the President had to remind Joe Biden that he supported the Green New Deal. He does. I mean the Green New Deal, I’m telling you, it would actually raise cost of electricity in your home and raise the cost of electricity in every business in Michigan. President Trump, he’s been a champion for American energy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","08:03"
"Mike Pence","We ended the war on coal. We’ve opened up our natural resources and we’re now a net exporter of energy for the first time in 70 years. It’s true. But worse still, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris over the last year said over and over again that they want to abolish fossil fuels and ban fracking. I mean, that would cost hundreds of thousands of direct jobs across the heartland. They said it over and over again. And then Joe Biden shows up in Pittsburgh, I wasn’t far from there today, a couple of weeks back. And he’s trying to convince people in Pennsylvania that he’s not for banning fracking. He actually said our President was lying about his record, remember? Even in that presidential debate and… How good did President Trump do in that presidential debate, am I right? Out of the park. Still going, right? Well, in that presidential debate, you saw the moment, where Joe Biden said that we needed to “transition from the oil industry.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","09:07"
"Mike Pence","President Trump said, “That’s a big statement.” And then when the President called him on it, he said, “Show the tape.” So, we’ve been showing the tape. And I bet when the President gets here, he’s going to show you the tape again. Men and women of Michigan, no matter what Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are saying right now, you can take it to the bank. Joe Biden and the democratic party are going to try and abolish fossil fuels, close down the oil industry, ban fracking, but we’re not going to let it happen. We’re going to have more fracking, more American energy, more energy independence for this generation and for generations to come when we reelect President Donald Trump for four more years!","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","10:22"
"Mike Pence","I mean, honestly, here’s the choice America faces. It’s a choice between a Trump boom and a Biden depression. I mean, a study just came out, non-partisan study that said Joe Biden’s economic policies would cost five million American jobs. And it would reduce the average income of American families by $6,500 a year. So, when you go home tonight, if you run into anybody tonight or any time on election day who hasn’t made a decision yet in Michigan, here’s what you got to ask them. Seriously. Just look at them and say, “Who do you really think can bring this economy all the way back? I mean, a career politician who’s spent 47 years raising taxes, stifling the economy with regulation and economic surrender, or a proven job creator who’s overseeing the fastest economic recovery in history to bring America all the way back?” We need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","11:24"
"Mike Pence","So, it’s about our economy, but we all know that security is the foundation of our prosperity, and I couldn’t be more proud to serve alongside a President who cares so deeply about the men and women of our armed forces and their families. You might not know we got some service members in our immediate family. My son’s a United States Marine. And my unworthy son-in-law is a United States Navy pilot currently deployed with the United States Navy. They couldn’t be with us tonight, but I couldn’t be more proud that that Navy spouse, my wonderful daughter, Charlotte Pence Bond is traveling with her mom and dad today. Would you say hi to her? So, proud of them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","12:42"
"Mike Pence","But you deserve to know when Joe Biden was vice president, we went through years of reckless budget cuts, didn’t we, John? I mean, they hollowed out our military readiness. And over the last few days I read where Democrats in Washington are already saying that they’re planning, they’re planning massive cuts to our national defense to pay for their big government program. President Trump, we rebuild our military. This president signed the largest investment in our national defense since the days of Ronald Reagan. And with four more years, we’re going to keep giving our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, and coast guard the resources and the support they need to defend our nation. And it’s not just been about those who serve in uniform, it’s been about those of you who did serve. When Joe Biden was vice president, we remember the scandals at the VA that shocked the conscience of the nation, don’t we?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","13:37"
"Mike Pence","I mean, we had veterans that were literally dying, waiting for care at the VA on waiting lists. But when President Trump came into the oval office, those days are over. Our president signed the most sweeping reforms of the VA in 50 years. We fired 3,000 VA employees who weren’t giving our veterans the care they deserve. The VA now has a 91% approval rating. And Veterans Choice is now available for every veteran in America. And for our national defense to support our veterans for peace through strength, it’s just one more reason why we need a combat veteran in the United States Senate. We need John James in the Senate from the great state of Michigan. And when it comes to law and order, President Donald Trump has stood with the men and women who serve on the thin blue line of law enforcement every single day. I mean, you all know what the President and I know, the men and women who put on the uniform of law enforcement in this country are some of the best people in America and they deserve the respect of every American every day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","14:36"
"Mike Pence","After the summer of violence that we’ve seen, after the rioting and looting that we saw in Philadelphia this week, the truth is Joe Biden would double down on the policies that are leading to violence in our cities. Now, Joe Biden says that America is, in his words, systemically racist. He says that law enforcement has an implicit bias against minorities. When Joe Biden was asked whether he’d cut funding for law enforcement, he replied, “Yes, absolutely.” And his running mate, Kamala Harris recently praised the LA mayor for cutting $150 million out of the LAPD’s budget. Under President Donald Trump, I’ll make you a promise. We’re not going to defund the police, not now, not ever. We’re going to back the blue and we’re going to back the blue for four more years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","16:09"
"Mike Pence","The President and I know we don’t have to choose between supporting law enforcement and supporting our African-American neighbors, and families, and other minorities in our cities. We’ve done both for the last three-and-a-half years, and we’re going to keep doing both. We’re going to support law enforcement with more resources and more training. And we’re going to keep creating jobs, and opportunity, and educational choice options for African-Americans and all the families that live in our major cities. And we’re going to have law and order for every American of every race, and creed, and color so help us, God. And all along the way under this President’s leadership, we’ve stood for all the liberties and freedoms enshrined in our founding documents, like the freedom of religion, the freedom of speech. And President Donald Trump has stood strong for the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms. We’ve appointed more than 220 conservative judges to our federal courts at every level. And I promise you, they’re all conservatives who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution, like Justice Neil Gorsuch, Justice Brett Kavanaugh, and just like Justice Amy Coney Barrett.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","17:21"
"Mike Pence","Isn’t she great? Isn’t she great? How much did you like that when they asked her what she had on that piece of paper in front of her? Nothing. She’s going to be an amazing jurors for generations to come, and she’s going to make America proud. But y’all deserve to know when Joe Biden was vice-president, we saw a steady assault on our religious freedom. We did. They used the power of the bureaucratic state to erode the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. They even hauled a group of Catholic nuns into federal court to force them to compromise their faith to live under the mandates of Obamacare. It’s true. When Judge Amy Coney Barrett was up for a different court two years ago, that same religious intolerance among the Democrats in Washington came out. The leading Democrat on the judiciary committee said she was concerned about Judge Barrett’s Catholic faith, because she said, and I quote, “the dogma lives loudly within you.” And Hollywood elites started attacking Judge Barrett and they’ve never stopped. Well, I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood… False alarm.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","18:54"
"Mike Pence","I got a message for the Democrats in Washington and their friends in Hollywood, that dogma lives loudly in me, that dogma lives loudly in you, and the right to live, and work, and worship according to the dictates of our faith lives loudly in the Constitution of the United States of America! And under President Donald Trump, we’ve stood for that first freedom, religious freedom strong. We restored the conscience rights of doctors and nurses. And it was President Donald Trump who ended the assault on the Little Sisters of the Poor and the Supreme Court made it permanent. And finally, where Joe Biden and Kamala Harris support taxpayer funding of abortion all the way up to the moment of birth. I couldn’t be more proud to be vice president to a president who stands without apology for the sanctity of human life. So, in our first three years, we rebuilt our military, we revived our economy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","20:32"
"Mike Pence","We stood for law and order, liberties, and life. None of that would have been possible without the strong support of Michigan’s Republicans in Congress. So, right after you reelect President Donald Trump, right after you send John James to the United States Senate, we all need Michigan to send Congressman Jack Bergman and Congressman John Moolenaar to a new Republican majority and retire Nancy Pelosi once and for all. Out. I’m telling you. Out. When you look at what we were able to accomplish all of us with the support of the people of Michigan, that historic election four years ago, I think there’s only one way you can describe it. In three short years, we made America great again. And then 2020 arrived as President Trump led our nation through the worst global pandemic in the century. And all along the way, President Donald Trump put the health of America first. It’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","21:47"
"Mike Pence","Before the first documented case of community spread, President Trump did what no American president had ever done in history. He closed off all travel from China, the second largest economy in the world. Now, Joe Biden at the time said that was xenophobic, which is I guess a fancy word for racist. He said closing off travel during a global pandemic would actually “make things worse.” But Joe Biden got it wrong and President Donald Trump got it right. I can tell you, as the head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force these last eight months, President Trump’s action shutting off travel to China saved untold American lives, because it bought us invaluable time to stand up the greatest national mobilization since World War II. It’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","23:24"
"Mike Pence","We reinvented testing. We saw to the manufacturing production, including here in Michigan, billions of supplies of medical equipment and PPE. We developed therapeutics that are saving lives. And we are literally a short time away from having the first safe Coronavirus vaccine and tens of millions of doses for the American people. And I promise you, people in Michigan can be confident. We’re going to keep making sure those supplies are available to our great doctors and nurses. We’re going to keep protecting the vulnerable. We’re going to keep saving lives and distribute a vaccine. And we are opening up America again. It’s amazing to think in the last five months on that foundation we poured and with the unprecedented relief for families and businesses the President secured from Congress, after losing 22 million jobs at the height of this pandemic, we’ve already seen 11-and-a-half million people go back to work, including 600,000 people right here in Michigan! We’re opening up America and Michigan is roaring back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","24:24"
"Mike Pence","But you all deserve to know, Joe Biden is talking about shutting down our economy again. It’s true. If you saw the newspapers the last couple of days, several European countries are already talking about shutting down. So, you can bet that Joe Biden will lockdown the American economy if he makes it to the White House. All the schools will be closed, all your churches, synagogues, places of worship. Businesses will all be shuttered again. Right at the moment that the American economy is getting back on its feet, Joe Biden said this summer he would shut it down. Well, Joe Biden says we’re in for a long dark winter, but under President Donald Trump, we’re going to defeat the virus and the best is yet to come. The choice in this election has never been clearer. The stakes have never been higher. When you look at their agenda: higher taxes, open borders, socialized medicine, Green New Deal, defunding the police, abortion on demand. It’s clear.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","25:41"
"Mike Pence","And Joe Biden would be nothing more than a Trojan horse for the radical left. I don’t know if you’ve seen it in the news, but Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are already angling for cabinet posts. Joe Biden said that democracy is on the ballot tomorrow. Well, I think our economic recovery is on the ballot. I think law and order are on the ballot. But I also think there are things far more foundational to our country that are on the ballot as well. Men and women in Michigan, in this election, I think it’s not going to be so much whether America ends up more Republican or more Democrat, more liberal or more conservative, more red or more blue. The choice in this election is whether America remains America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","26:54"
"Mike Pence","Whether we’re going to chart a future with President Donald Trump, build on our American heritage of faith, and family, and patriotism, and freedom, or whether we’re going to let Joe Biden and the democratic parties surrender our country to the radical left, shut down our economy, topple our heritage, and our values, and our freedom in an avalanche of socialism in decline. So, let me say from my heart to all of my friends here in Michigan, for all the ideals and values that have always made this country unique and exceptional, for our very freedom bequeathed to us by generations of Americans, we need to decide right here and right now that Joe Biden will never be president of the United States. We’re going to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years. Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve gotten to know this president over the last four years. Some people think we’re a little bit different, but actually we’ve gotten to be very close friends.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","27:54"
"Mike Pence","We spend time together every day or we speak every day, and I can tell you, President Donald Trump is the real deal. He’s a man who says what he means and means what he says. He never quits, he never backs down, and he has never stopped fighting to keep the promises that he made to the American people. Now, it’s our turn to fight for him. It’s our turn to fight for four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House! Four more years means more jobs. Four more years means more judges. Four more years means more support for our troops. And it’s going to take at least four more years to drain that swamp.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","29:23"
"Mike Pence","So, before he gets here, I got a couple of things to ask you to do. Number one, before the polls close tomorrow, we need you to vote Michigan, vote to reelect President Donald Trump for four more years! The time for speeches is almost over, the time for voting is coming up. Tomorrow morning, I’m told the polls open 7:00 AM open till 8:00 PM here in Michigan. And remember friends don’t let friends vote alone. Bring a family member, bring a neighbor, bring a co- worker, and vote to reelect President Donald Trump to the White House. And secondly, after you vote with a friend, I need you to go find somebody to talk to about this election. I mean, Michigan always plays an outsized role in presidential politics, and that’ll be especially true this year. And the choice that Michigan makes is literally going to be a choice that sets our nation on one path or another for generations to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","30:21"
"Mike Pence","So, you just need to tell them about the stakes in this election. Tell them about the progress we made, the way this president has led us through this challenging year, the way we rebuilt our military and revived our economy, the way America is coming back, and tell them about the choice, and tell them why. The President and I were on a news show a week ago Sunday, 60 Minutes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Right. But there was a great moment. So, the President got asked a question. His answer, I’ll just never forget. The reporter looks at him and she says, thinking about all of you, she said, “So, how would you describe your supporters?” And without hesitation, the President answered the question. She said, “How would you describe your supporters?” And he said, “They are people who love our country.” So, go find a neighbor, tell them you love America, and tell them we need four more years of President Donald Trump in the White House!","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","31:38"

"Mike Pence","And then finally, I just encourage you in all that remains in between now and when the polls close just to have faith. Have faith in America when you speak to your neighbors and friends. I think you study American history. Every time the American people are given a clear choice between a future of more freedom and less freedom, they choose freedom every time. Have faith in the boundless capacity of the American people to overcome any challenge. And finally, have faith that he who planted this miracle of democracy on these wilderness shores will see us through these challenging times to bring us through stronger and better than ever before. There’s a verse that’s been over the mantle of our home for 20 years since we first stepped forward to serve in public life. And they’re ancient words that Americans have long clung to and our little family does. They simply say for I know the plans I have for you, plans to prosper you, not to harm you, plans to give you a hope and a future.

You had a great year last year, the year before, the year before, three great years, the best you’ve ever had, and you’re going to have the best year you ever had next year. We’re all set. You saw what happened. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever, ever, ever recorded, 33.1%. You saw that on Friday. We created a record 11.4 million jobs in the last five months. That’s a record, while foreign nations are in a free fall, sadly in a free fall. And you look at what’s happening with Europe and other places. Very sad. We are creating an economic powerhouse unrivaled anywhere in the world. You look at our numbers, look at the auto numbers. Look at what’s happening with that business and so many other businesses in this country, but that business because we happen to be in a place that likes automobiles, right.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","55:45"

And that’s during a pandemic and we’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner and you got to open your states. You got to open your state, open it, open it up Governor. Open it up Governor. Open it up Governor. Got to open it up. If Biden and Harris and the radical left gain power, they will collapse our economy and send our nation into a very steep depression. They want to raise taxes at a level that nobody’s ever heard of before. Biden will raise your taxes over $4 trillion. It’s not him. Do you think it’s him? He doesn’t have a clue. He has no clue, but that’s okay. Let’s assume he does. We have to win. So that’s sad. Can’t do that to our country. Our country has too much unbelievable potential actually. Massively increasing your regulations, shutting down your economy. They’re going to close down your factory, send your jobs overseas to China and other places.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","56:47"

The women of the suburbs, they love me I think, but the fake news says they don’t, but I think they do. They love their home. They love their house. They don’t want a development put next to the house. They want their house the way it is. They want to have their beautiful house and they want to have security and they want to have safety. I think they like Trump. I really do. That happened the last time. That happened four years ago. Remember they said, “Women will not vote for Donald Trump at that time. Women will not.” And then at the end of the evening where they were all crying, they say, “Women, what happened?” The women came out, right. The women like us.

They want to dissolve your borders, maybe rip down the wall. They were talking about that. Let’s take down the wall. We have our strongest border right now and the wall is almost complete. Mexico is paying for the wall by the way, but it’s almost complete. Terminate religious liberty, outlaw private care, 180 million people they want to take it away, go to socialized medicine. I don’t think so. You’ve worked hard for that. You have some of the greatest healthcare in the world. You’ve worked hard for it. They want to take it away. 180 million private plans, take it away. Now, if you feel a little bad or if you want to check up, you go to a hospital, you wait in line for about six weeks, and you get yourself checked out. They say you have a problem.

So they said, “Listen, you have to be in favor of fracking now.” They said, “Okay, no problem. Why? I only said it about 200 times during debates, right.” So now he goes into Pennsylvania where we just left. Great people by the way.

Everyone’s watching politics because they find politics to be much rougher than the NFL. It’s much dirtier and more disgusting. And they don’t change. You know, in the NFL, they change the rules. They make everything like coming back. You can’t touch anybody. Somebody tackles too hard. They say 15 yard penalty and you’re out of the game, and you’re out for the season. You know, in the old days, right? It was a little different, but it’s still tough. But this is much tougher and people see it. But you have to see the ratings. That’s why the ratings are bad for a lot of the sports. Nobody ever thought of this. But I thought of it. A couple of people wrote it. The ratings to bed because so many people are watching this. It’s tougher. It’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","01:17:41"
"President Trump","But they’re going to be calling for us, “Please, please run again. We think we’re going to endorse you.” I got endorsed by the Pittsburgh, right, Pittsburgh Post Gazette. I got endorsed, first time since 1972 that they endorsed, right? It’s a big deal. Big newspaper, very good, very liberal newspaper, but that’s okay. But first time since 1972 that they endorsed a Republican, so it’s an honor. And if you don’t read the first two or three paragraphs, it was one of the best endorsements. “Yes. We don’t like him. Yes. He has a horrible personality.” But listen to this. It’s not that I do, but I have been under siege illegally for three and a half years.

You know, we’d have a very calm situation and maybe I’d be less popular. I don’t know. Maybe I’d be less popular. Because you know what the fact is, people see that we fight. We’re fighting for you. But it’s a really dirty, horrible business. But I said today, because were saying they don’t like the personality and he’s always fighting. I’m fighting to survive. You have to survive. Very few people would have survived. They would have been in the corner. They would have said, “Mommy, mommy,” put their finger in the mouth, put their thumb in the mouth and say, “Mommy, mommy, take me home. I’m out of here. Get me the hell out of here.” They’d say, “Forget about the American people. Mommy.

We have a great group of people. We have a lot of them here tonight. Great people in the White House. But it’s true. I wonder if it would have been different. We caught them spying on our campaign. We caught them trying to take out a duly elected President of the United States. That’s treason. That’s treason. We caught them. And someday, maybe something’s going to be done about it, too. You know? Maybe. Boy, oh boy, oh boy. We don’t want to do anything prior to the election. Well, what about me? They did it to me before. They spied my campaign before the election.

You wouldn’t even believe it. I don’t even get involved. I always said I’m going to stay uninvolved. Very hard for me to do, I’ll tell you. No, it is because I didn’t have to do that. I thought it’d be the right thing. And yet they did the Mueller report, right? The phony Mueller report, 18 angry Democrats, smart, 18 angry vicious, many of them work for Hillary Clinton, 18 angry Democrats. They spent $48 million. And at the end of two and a half years, no collusion. Okay? Friend of mine said, “You have to be the most innocent of the world.” And they checked everything. They checked taxes.

They say, “Well, prepaying isn’t paying.” I said, “No, it’s prepaying. That’s even worse.” Millions of dollars, many millions of dollars. And that’ll all come out. And you know, when you look at it, when you look at what’s gone on, seriously, think of that. Just think about that tonight when you’re with your family. I wonder if it would’ve been different. I wonder if it would have been a different kind of a feel. And you know what? Honestly, maybe it wouldn’t have been as good. Maybe we wouldn’t have these massive crowds, because you see what somebody is where we’re under siege, and you people get it. You’re smarter than them. You’re smarter than these people. You get it. And you’ve always gotten it and it’s a beautiful thing. And I’ll never forget it. I want to tell you, I’m never going to forget it.

They don’t do that. They’re unbelievable kids, military. But you know, “Let’s go to China today, dad. I’d like to follow you.” Walks out with one and a half billion dollars fees.

That’s millions of dollars in fees. The big one was the $10 million. You saw that one, the letter. He wants $10 million a year for introductory purposes. Okay? $10 million. But it all blew up. By that time, the laptop from hell was found. The one that Schiff said was developed in Russia. It’s unbelievable. And then you have Ukraine. He goes into Ukraine. His father was a judge of Ukraine, right? He was a judge of Russia, Ukraine, China, specifically. He goes into Ukraine, $183,000 a month. “Do you have energy experience?” It’s in energy. Right? Burisma. “Do you have energy experience?” “No, I don’t. I don’t know anything about energy.” “Well, we’ll pay you $183,000 a month and we’ll give you an upfront fee of approximately $3 million.

He wants to look like Tom Cruise from a long time ago. No, but he’s fragile. He’s not going to be there. That’s not what they’re counting on. They’re counting on somebody else.

That was the first thing, trade. I said, “How could they do that?” They supported Biden. The open borders, lobbyists, that killed our fellow citizens with illegal drugs and gangs and crime that poured into our country, they support Biden.

Probably before Joe thought he could ever run. You know, Joe thought his career was over because he wasn’t thinking straight. Then he ran and Elizabeth Warren said, “I want to stay until the end and take out Bernie.” You know, she took out Bernie, and we’re running against Joe instead of Bernie, and Bernie is going to run again though in another four years. He’s going to run again. One thing about that guy, he never gives up. Does he? But he’s a hell of a loser. I mean, he loses the first time and he goes back. He’s like, no hard feelings.

We can’t let that happen, everybody knows it. And if he were a nice guy, he’s never been a nice guy, he’s never been a smart guy, never been smart, everyone knows it, never been smart. But if he was a nice guy, we wouldn’t even do that but that’s just a very small version, that’s not even the bad stuff.

Are you in good shape with your races, you don’t need any additional help? They’re probably about 30 points up. When somebody is good, they’re good. You guys are great, thank you very much.

No, he’s supposed to be a great warrior actually, I got him to run and he got his feet a little wet and then he just took off and I understand you’re doing very well to that poll, John, I hear.

And his competition, nobody knows who the hell he is, Peters. You have a great State, Michigan. They say, “Oh, who’s the Senator?” Peters, Peters, “Who the hell is Peters everyone says.” Nobody knows who he is. He’s a puppet for crying Chuck Schumer I guess, that’s about it. Anyway, good luck John James, everyone. You have to do it. Okay. Another great gentlemen, house speaker Lee Chatfield. Good, nice to see you. I hear you’re doing good. And a woman who is special to this part of the world because she headed up our campaign and she kept calling, calling, please one more visit because a Republican hasn’t won Michigan for many, many years, decades, long time. So she’d call, “Please come over,” so I’d do it, “Come over.” Can I do it again?

But she would just say, “One more time.” So now it’s toward the end, toward the end and I call and I said, “How we doing?” She said, “You’re going to maybe win, but you have to do just one more visit, that’s all.” So I did one more. I wished her well and I said, “Hey, the elections in three days and I want to just thank you for working so hard.” “Thank you very much, I won’t call you again.” I got home and I got a phone call from her. She said, “You need one more time, one more time.” And I came and we ended up, was that sometime? And I started speaking at 1 o’clock in the morning, now it was election day and we had 32,000 people, is that right? We had 32,000 people and I looked and I said, it was 1 in the morning.

In the early voting, then we catch them on election day, I don’t know, for whatever reason, that’s the way it is. We vote on election day. They’re not way ahead and they’re having a lot of problems and they have emergency calls out to people. It’s going to be very interesting. Let’s do the great red wave, okay? And get that guy in to, John, we need them. We need them in Washington. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders, but now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities and we are bringing our jobs, our factories and our troops back home to the good old USA. It’s about time. The troops are coming back. They’re policemen, we were serving as policemen all over the world, we’re policemen, no, it’s not what it’s all about. For 47 years Joe Biden, viciously attacked Black Americans. He called young Black men super predators. To every Black American I am asking you to go out and vote for Donald J. Trump. This is your one and only chance to show sleepy Joe Biden what you think of his decision to attack you, to jail you and to betray you and nobody’s done it worse than him. I’m fighting for you, I got you criminal justice reform, prison reform, opportunity zones with Tim Scott, great guy, Tim Scott. And funding for historically Black colleges and universities, which were treated extremely badly. Under my leadership we achieved so much, so much. I said that, and I made the statement during debate, nobody saw the debate last week, did you? Nobody? Two weeks ago, it was a good debate. But I said, “Nobody with perhaps the exception of Abraham Lincoln,” a lot of people said, “Could you do the perhaps the exception out, please?” “has done more for the Black community than Donald Trump,” and that’s true. President Trump, all those things and more, and that’s good and you know what? It’s showing up to.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","01:54:39"

Hispanic numbers in Florida, they’re saying, “What’s going on with Hispanic?” Hispanic Americans love Trump and I love them and I have a long time. The Black community is going to a level that we haven’t seen in a long time. It’s a beautiful thing to watch and they are saying, “What is going on?” This could be something very interesting that you’re going to be watching. You’re going to be watching some very good television tomorrow night. Very good television. Well, you have to say four years ago, was that the most exciting evening in the history of television? Remember how it started? This will be a very short evening for Donald Trump. This will be very easy, very short and then they say, ” Donald Trump has won the state of Ohio,” but it wasn’t just that we won by eight points.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","01:57:06"

He’s one their firewall, North Carolina and he won it by a lot. What’s going on? Donald Trump has just won Wisconsin. He’s just won Michigan.” And they held Pennsylvania, even though if I lost every vote in the 2%, I still would have won by a lot, they held it. So you and Wisconsin got credit and that’s okay, right? But I just hope Pennsylvania, next time you take credit, so let’s do it a little bit earlier, please. No, we’re going to do fantastically in Pennsylvania but that was one of the most exciting evenings ever. And I think we’re going to duplicate it, I don’t know, could you ever surpass something like that? But we’re going to at least duplicate it and we need it to carry on what we’ve been doing.

Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure Southern border in U.S history. The Biden Harris group would increase refugees from terrorist nations by over 700% and that’s the manifesto that was agreed to with Crazy Bernie. Including from Syria, Somalia, and Yemen, right? You know that. The Biden plan would overwhelm your communities and turn Michigan, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the entire Midwest into a refugee camp. You’re talking about tremendous amounts of people coming into our country. We don’t know who they are, we don’t know anything about them.

If it’s okay with you, we put the ban on because we want people to come into our country who are going to love us, who are going to help us, not people that are going to hurt us and blow up buildings. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military, the largest investment in the military we’ve ever made, we have to do it. All made in the USA, a lot of it made right here in your great state, a lot of it. And we now have the greatest equipment anywhere in the world, fighter jets, F35’s, we have the best tanks, we have the best rockets and missiles. We have the hydrosonic missile that goes 7 times faster right now than the fastest missile in the world. If it went by us, we’d say, “What was that?” It would start over there before you could turn your head it would be over. 7 times, think of that, seven times faster, it’s incredible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","02:00:18"

We’re making submarines the likes of which nobody’s ever seen before, we’re doing it all. And when I took over, it was depleted, our military was depleted, we had old fighter jets. You had to go to the desert, it was called the Graveyard for airplanes, right? And you’d strip planes that were sitting in the desert rotting in the desert and you’d bring the parts back. This was what we were flying in our airplanes. Now we have new tankers, we have the new super fighters. It’s incredible what we’ve done and much of it’s already here, much of it’s coming, but it’s all made in our great country. We just passed the VA choice in VA accountability and nobody thought that could be done and we just got, as I told you, 91% approval from our vets, our great vets.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","02:01:14"
"President Trump","We obliterated 100% of the ISIS caliphate, people don’t talk about that. When I took over, it was a mess. It was all over the place, we obliterated it. We killed the leader of ISIS, Al-Baghdadi. And we eliminated the world’s top terrorist, Soleimani is dead. I recognized the capital of Israel and open the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights, they were working on that for 52 years. And instead of endless wars we’re forging peace all over the Middle East, they’re all getting together, they’re all getting together. A vote for me and the Republican party and John James and everybody, it’s a vote for the American dream and in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all, that’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. With God’s help we will defend the right to life, religious liberty.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-mike-pence-rally-speech-transcript-traverse-city-michigan-november-2","Donald Trump & Mike Pence Rally Speech Transcript Traverse City, Michigan November 2","02:02:15"

That’s where we need John and everybody to help us and our great congressmen, they’ve been so great and we appreciate it. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices beyond any levels you’ve ever seen, 60, 70, 80%. I’ve instituted favored nations that drug companies do not like me, they do not like me. They’re taking out more commercials, I think, than sleepy Joe, but we’re going to get it done. Our prices are the highest in the world for many years by far and we’re bringing them down to the lowest price anywhere in the world, matching the lowest price.
