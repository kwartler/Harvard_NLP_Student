"President Donald J. Trump","Wow. Thank you very much. And hello, Goodyear. Hello, Phoenix. Six days, can you believe this? Six days from now we are going to win Arizona and we are going to win four more years in our great, beautiful White House. A vote for me is a vote for massive tax cuts, regulation cuts, fair trade, strong borders, our Second Amendment, we will save our Second Amendment, and American energy independence. It’s a vote to support our police, our military, stand up to China, which we’ve been doing. They gave $28 billion to our farmers. That’s very nice. Thank you very much, China. And ensure more products that are proudly stamped with that beautiful phrase, “Made in the U.S.A.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","00:08"
"President Donald J. Trump","We will deliver record prosperity, epic job growth, and a safe vaccine that eradicates the virus, the China Plague is what it is, and quickly end the pandemic. Normal life, which is what we want, we just want normal life, like we had seven months ago. We’ll fully resume, and next year we will be the greatest economic power. We are going to be stronger than we’ve ever been before. And you see that all happening. Next year will be the best economic year in our country’s history. And last year was, and then we were interrupted. We were interrupted. It’s called Make America Great Again, Again. A vote for Joe Biden, Sleepy Joe, is a vote for the biggest tax hike in history. I’ve never seen this before, a man who’s campaigning on the fact that he’s going to raise your taxes. I have seen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","01:18"

"President Donald J. Trump","They’re going to crush, regulations, it will be crushing. You have no idea what they want to do. We’ve took off more regulations than any administration in the history of our country. They are going to put those regulations back, and all they do is cause waste and a lot of other problems, slash Medicare and social security, and they want to abolish American energy. You know what he said, “No fracking.” He said, “No fracking.” Until he went to Pennsylvania, then he said, “Maybe we can frack.” His people won’t let them frack and Joe doesn’t have any clue where he is. You know that. “Where am I? Where am I? What state am I in?” He’s only got it wrong about seven times. “Where am I? Is this Arizona or is this Nevada? Where am I? Tell me, where am I? Is this Iowa? Oh, oh, oh, oh, it’s very hot. I know where I am. This is Florida, isn’t it?” “No, Joe.

"President Donald J. Trump","A vote for Biden is a vote for open borders, offshoring jobs, shredding the Second Amendment, confiscating your guns, and eliminating private healthcare. 180 million people on private healthcare. It’s called bye-bye. And they love their private healthcare. Biden and the Democrat socialists will delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, shutter your schools and shut down our country. And your state is open, right? Your state is nice and open. Your state is nice and open. Thank you. Your Governor did a good job. I don’t know if you appreciate it, but he did a good job. You had a spike, and he just did what he had to do. And your state is fully open. Good job. He may be here. He may be in this crowd of about 25,000 people. He may be here.

I am fighting for the dreams of all Americans, including millions of truly amazing, and they like me, my poll numbers are through the roof with, Hispanic Americans, right? Through the roof. I always knew they liked me. It’s a big story. They say, “What’s going on?” I just saw it. “What’s going on with Trump and the Hispanics? What’s going on with Trump? His poll numbers.” They’re getting very nervous. Our poll numbers are looking very good. We had one little upset this morning. We’re doing very well in Wisconsin, right? I was there yesterday. We had 25,000 people at least. And I will tell you, it was cold.

But that’s the phrase, one of the greatest men in the country right here, did you ever hear that phrase before? I don’t think so. Oh, we have Mike Lee here too. And we have Rand Paul here and Sergio, and the King of Europe we have right here. Rand, did you ever hear that phrase for a politician?

"President Donald J. Trump","So we’ve got some great polls and we are getting great polls. We are doing great in Florida. Doing great in North Carolina. Doing great I think in Pennsylvania, I think. I think it’s going to be great. We won it last time. First time in many years, a Republican won. We’ve done good. Brought a lot of business there. They had a lot of business went back to Pennsylvania, so I think they appreciate it, but haven’t seen the numbers. They vote late. They vote on Tuesday. That’s what they like. I like that too. But we’re doing good all over. We’re doing good in Wisconsin. We have a poll. We’re one up in Wisconsin. Don’t clap yet. Today, the fake Washington Post, ABC, you’d think they come out that he’s four down, he’s five down. “17 down in Wisconsin.” I don’t think so. I had the same fraudsters here four years ago, they had me 12 down a week before the election, right? Remember that, I was 12 down? ABC, Washington Post, I mean, just dishonest people. And we sent them a legal letter and by the time we got to the election, we were even. I wonder what happened. But they interviewed slightly more Democrats and Republicans. We looked at it. I think there’s some kind of a law that you have to do that. They interviewed a few more, a number that you wouldn’t even believe.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","06:46"

It’s a big con job. It’s a big con job. They spend all that money for public relations, and then I talk about them, that’s the end of the public relations. Con job. How did you guys do today, please, on Section 230. Mike Lee, how are you doing? You know what? What they’re doing is a disgrace. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and they refuse to talk about it. You’ve got to do it. You’ve got to do it. I mean, it’s crazy. They’re getting away, what the big tech is getting away with. They will not allow anybody to even discuss it. With me, they write false stories, they can do whatever they want. Section 230, Rand. I hope you’re all looking at it, okay? I hope you’re all looking at it.

"President Donald J. Trump","They were up there and they were very nervous in front of the Senate. They were very nervous. I have to tell you that. They were shaken up a little bit, because without Section 230, they don’t even exist. They don’t even exist. For 47 years, Joe Biden betrayed the American people and he betrayed Hispanic Americans. Over the last four years, I’ve been delivering for Hispanic Americans like never before. And Hispanic American unemployment reached an all time low prior to the pandemic.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","09:18"

"President Donald J. Trump","It’s crazy. I love you too. Nobody knows what happened. The fake news, look at all of them back there. That’s a lot of fake news back there. Look at that. Those red lights just went off. Anytime I refer to them, they turn the light off very quickly. They don’t want to have it broadcast when I call CNN bad names. Hispanic American families saw their net worth skyrocket by 64%. And I’m sitting in the hottest sun I’ve ever felt. This is hot. My last stop also in your great state, it had a different problem. The sun was hot. I’ve never seen wind like that. It’s lucky I don’t need teleprompters like Sleepy Joe because the teleprompters were falling down. They were going all over the place. I was getting a headache. I’m trying to look. But I have a good memory. I remember things unlike the sleepy one. He’s in a lid again. Did you know that, fellas? He’s in lid. This guy’s in a lid every single day. Lid, that refers to a garbage can. They put the lid on the can.

"President Donald J. Trump","By the way, I’d like to be in a basement. I’d like to be in some place. I’d like to be in a beautiful bedroom, nice for a year and a half, two years, never come out of the White House. But I’m your President, I have to. I have to come out. I have to meet people. I have to meet people. We have to meet people. And I said, “This could be a little bit shaky, to meet a lot of people, but we have no choice.” And you probably haven’t heard, but I caught it. I caught it. Did anybody know that? I caught it. And then you get better and you’re immune. And they say, “You’re immune for a year.” They used to say you’re immune forever, but when I got it, I said, “I’m immune.” They said, “It’s only for four months.” I don’t know what happened. They said, “You’re immune for a lifetime,” right? Remember? Until I had it.

"President Donald J. Trump","But I got better. Great doctors at the White House. We have great doctors. Great doctors all over the country. I had doctors from all over the country. One thing I learned quickly, when you’re the President and you’re not feeling too good, I didn’t feel great, you have more doctors than you’ve ever seen in your life before. It was like a public place. And they were gathered around my bed. They said, “What’s the problem?” I said, “I don’t know, doc, but I’m not feeling too good. And I’ve got to get back on the trail.” You know what the trail is, right? The campaign trail. “I’ve got to get back on the trail. Get me the hell out of here, doc.” John’s Hopkins was great. We have all the great hospitals represented. And I’ll tell you, Walter Reed is incredible. I’ve seen what they do to the soldiers. They come back so badly wounded and they fix them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","12:14"

"President Donald J. Trump","Thank you. Thank you. Walter Reed is so great, but they’re all around and they’re saying, “Sir, I think you’re going to have to take it easy for a little while.” Then they gave me something called Regeneron. Did you ever hear of Regeneron? And we’re going to make it available to everybody that needs it free. Free, right? Free. Antibodies. And all I know, and I don’t want to give any credit to this drug, I want to say it was me, because I’m in perfect physical condition, and I’m very young. I’m very young and I’m in perfect physical shape. Perfect. I said that jokingly. I said that a couple of weeks ago. CNN, fake news CNN, went crazy. “He’s not in perfect shape and he’s not young.” They went crazy. They thought it was horrible.

"President Donald J. Trump","No, we did a great job, and I would like to say that the antibody, what they gave me, didn’t help, but it probably did, because I woke up the next morning and I felt like Superman.

We’re going to win this election. We’re going to have a great victory. And a lot of people want to go out on Tuesday, they don’t want to go out early. It’s called the Great Red Wave. Wait until you see. They always say, “Sir, could you please ask them to go out on Monday, Sunday?” Because you could go out now, you can vote, right? But I said, “They don’t really want that.” They want to make it a little more convenient for you, but when those boosts open up, you’re going to see something that probably has never seen before. You’ve never seen. In Florida, they’re not doing well. They had to get that lead.

"President Donald J. Trump","The biggest problem we have is if they cheat with the ballots. That’s my biggest problem. That’s the only thing I worry about. If they cheat with the ballots, right? If they cheat with the ballots. And they did find some in a garbage can from the military, military ballots. It had the name Trump written, they wanted to go for Trump. They found them in a garbage can, hundreds of thousands every day. You don’t wake up and not read a story about it. Every day there’s cheating with the ballots. And you have governors, Democrat Governors, that are players, wise guys. Wise guys and it’s a disgrace. In Nevada, we like Nevada, but you’ve got a Governor There that’s a player. And even if you want to speak, they make it very hard to find a location. But we found one and 50,000 people showed up a couple of weeks ago.

"President Donald J.

To bring even greater opportunity and prosperity to Latinos and the Latino community, and I say the Latinos and I say the Hispanics, and I have a lot of friends, I say, “What do you like better?” They said, “You can call us anything.” The Latino community in Arizona and around the country, today, I’m announcing the American Dream Plan. Over the next four years, the American Dream Plan will bring more than two million new jobs to Hispanic communities, create over a half a million new Hispanic owned, small businesses, which will end up being large businesses if I know you, and I know you well, great business people, great natural business people, expand opportunities for federal contracting, it’s going to be much easier for you to get some of those jobs, and increase access to capital by hundreds of billions of dollars.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","16:26"

More Hispanic Americans be able to buy a home, to afford quality health insurance, and to raise their families in a beautiful, safe neighborhood.

You know how quick we can fix that? Mike Lee, we can fix that in about, what, 30 minutes, right? The Governor has to call up.

Taken a long time and if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment it’s because I was elected to fight for you harder than any President has ever fought for their constituents before.

"Nigel Farage","Oh, I’m known controversial and shy compared to you. I got to say four years ago, I was honored to come to America to bring the Brexit message. The message that you can beat the establishment. And that is what Donald Trump did. He beat the pollsters. He beat the media. He beat all the predictions and here’s the worst bit they’ve never forgiven him for it. They’ve never ever forgiven him, they have spent four years trying to de-legitimize him. Four years of the Russia hoax, four years of a false impeachment. Most human beings under that barrage would’ve given up. This is the single most resilient and bravest person I have ever met in my life.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","51:42"
"Nigel Farage","And when you vote next week, you are not just voting for who the president of the United States of America is, vital though that question may be, you are voting for the leader of the free world. You are voting for the only current leader in the free world who has got the guts to stand up and fight for the nation states, to fight for patriotism, to fight against globalism. You’ll be voting for the only leader in the Western world with a real courage to stand up to the Chinese communist party. You’ll be voting for decency, plain speaking and a man who in four years, hasn’t just cut your taxes. Hasn’t just improved the economy. But a man who right now is bringing Israel together with Arab nations in a way that nobody ever believed was possible, and that’s what he’s done. And I wish you God’s speed. I really do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","52:43"

"President Donald J. Trump","A friend of mine who is a brilliant, brilliant gentleman, he loves fights. He just loves fighting. He’s somebody that’s made a lot of money with fighting. A lot of people say, “Oh, let’s not fight,” but he disagrees. He owns that he’s the head of the UFC. You know what that is? Dana White. The great Dana White. Thank you, Dana. Thank you.

"President Donald J. Trump","Together, we built the greatest economy in history and now we’re doing it again. We increased middle-class family income over $5,000, more than five times the gains under the last administration. After the virus arrived, we passed $3 trillion of economic relief and saved over 50 million jobs, many in your state, many, many in your state. We’ve experienced the smallest contraction and the fastest recovery economically by far of any major nation in the world. That’s a big thing. And our numbers are going to be coming out very shortly, very soon. GDP, and the Fed in Atlanta just made a prediction, they said 35%. Now, I’ll take 25 right now. 35 would be many times larger than the largest number we’ve ever had. GDP, the all-important GDP, 35 is what they predict and let’s see what happens. And it’ll be three days before the election. So I’ll make you a deal. If the number’s a bad number, you don’t have to-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","55:56"
"President Donald J. Trump","… election. So I’ll make you a deal, if the number’s a bad number, you don’t have to vote for me. Okay? But I think it’s going to be incredible. If you look at housing starts, if you look at automobile and all the productivity that we’ve had, if you looked at hiring, 11.4 million people over a short period of time. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. And we built over 400 miles of new wall, including 200 miles right here in the State of Arizona, 200 miles. It goes down very deep and it goes up very high. There are two reasons it goes down deep. One is to hold it up, and the other is for tunnels. You never had it so good. And your numbers are fantastic.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","57:03"
"President Donald J. Trump","Joe Biden has pledged to open borders. He even said, “Maybe we’ll rip down the wall.” I don’t think that’s going to happen. He wants open borders. If you don’t have borders, you don’t have a country. His plan would completely eliminate our borders, by implementing nationwide catch and release. You catch them, killer, a rapist, whoever it is, and you release them into our country. And then in the debate, he said, “Oh, but they come back for trial.” No, they don’t, Joe. They don’t come back. You don’t see them again. This would trigger a tsunami of illegal immigration from every corner, all over the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","57:48"

"President Donald J. Trump","He’s also pledged to, and you know what he wants to do, give free healthcare and mass amnesty for all illegal border crosses, bankrupting your Medicare and your social security systems. I don’t think so. And we all have a heart. We want to take care of people, but everybody all over the world would pour into our country. We wouldn’t be able to do it. Under Biden’s plan, you’ll have no borders, no healthcare, no middle-class. You’ll have no country, frankly. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, including nearly $1 billion to build the world’s most advanced guided missiles. Guess where we’re building them? Right here in Arizona. Right? We also passed the VA Choice and VA Accountability, things said that, “You’ll never get them done, sir. You’ll never get it done.” We got them both done. Accountability, where we can fire bad people that work at the VA, that don’t love our vets. We take care of our vets and now they don’t have to wait for two weeks, three weeks, five weeks, seven weeks.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","58:23"
"President Donald J. Trump","Now they go, and if they can’t get good service… We have great doctors in the VA. But if you can’t get the service, you go to a local doctor, a local hospital, we take care of the bill. We have a 91% approval rating now, the highest ever by far with our guys. We took 100% of the ISIS caliphate and we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We took out the world’s top terrorist. Soleimani is dead. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. $150 billion for nothing, for nothing. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and even got it built. And even got it built. Right? I even got it built. Got it built for, supposed to cost $2 billion, we did it for 500,000, a slight cost underrun. That was called the cost underrun. You don’t see that in government too much. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. I got it done in about two hours. Every president promised these things, but they never got them done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","59:33"
"President Donald J. Trump","There’s a lot of pressure on people when you have that Jerusalem, Golan Heights, a lot of pressure, but we got them done. And instead of never ending wars, we are forging peace in the Middle East. We are forging peace. And I’ve said this, and I’ve said it a lot, but I meet it with every breath, I’ve done more in 47 months then sleepy Joe Biden has done in 47 years and it’s true. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs and the American dream. Abraham Lincoln was a great Republican, and [inaudible 01:01:32] remember that. I can be more presidential than any president other than possibly Abraham Lincoln, when he’s wearing the hat. That’s a tough one. No, he was a great Republican.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","01:00:54"
"President Donald J. Trump","Over the next four years, in conclusion, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. That’s already started. We will make our medical supplies right here in the United States, right here in Arizona. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend religious liberty free speech, the right to life and the right to keep and bear arms, Second Amendment. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. And the 2.5 trillion, all made in the USA, we have the finest missiles and rockets and tanks and submarines and jets, the F-35 stealth. You can’t see it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-goodyear-az-october-28","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Goodyear, AZ October 28","01:01:43"
"President Donald J. Trump","“Sir, you can’t see it. That makes it good.” I said, “I think that makes it good. What do I know?” But I know if you’re the opponent and you can’t see the jet, you know what? You got a little advantage there. Now we have the best in the world and our nuclear arsenal has been refurbished and restocked and hope to God, we never have to use it. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. Already completed, goes into effect… Bigger than healthcare, you watch on January 1st. Lower drug prices, even more. First year in 52 years, that drug prices, prescription went down, when I instituted what’s called a favored-nations clause. We pay the most in the world. We’re now going to be tied for the lowest price in the world. We will protect your social security and your Medicare.

And NASA is now again the preeminent space station. There’s nothing like what we have. What a job they’ve all done, including our great Vice President, Mike Pence. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, “In God we trust.” For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the people of Arizona. From tombstone to Tucson, right? Tucson, does anybody come from Tucson?

Arizona’s where Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday became American legends. It’s where the great American West became the American dream. And Arizona is the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors, miners and ranchers, cowboys, and cattle hands, marshals and lawman, tamed the frontier, braved the blazing sun, like I’m doing right now, and showed the entire world how the west was won. They helped make America into the greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.
