"Donald Trump","Well thank you very much. Thank you. What a crowd. This is a very great place. We had a great victory here four years ago. And I just noticed their happened to be a poll out, that came out last night, that has a very, very substantial margin. We’re very happy with it. We’re very happy with it, and we’re very happy with Iowa, thank you very much Iowa. And we appreciate it. And we’ve had a great run together, and I’ve been working very hard with the farmers, and making them hopefully very rich. Making them very rich, and very successful, and hello to everyone here also from Wisconsin. We have a lot of people from Wisconsin.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","03:26"
"Donald Trump","All right. Let’s see. Who is from Iowa? And who is from Wisconsin? All right. That’s not terrible. That’s not bad. We just left Wisconsin, and we’re going back to Wisconsin. Two days from now we are going to win Iowa and we are going to win Wisconsin. And we are going to win four more years in that very beautiful White House. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, and ensure that more products are made, and raised, and grown in the USA. That’s what’s happening. That’s what’s happening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","04:12"
"Donald Trump","Next year we’ll be, I think we’re going to have the greatest year, economically speaking, in the history of our country. You saw the number that just came out. 33.1 GDP. That’s the best number in the history of our country. And we’re set. We call it a super V. We used to say a V, now we’re calling it a super V. Under my leadership, our economy is now growing at the fastest rate ever, we’re truly something. We’re set. We’re all set. We were doing better than ever before. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country, and then we got hit by the China plague, which we’re not going to forget.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","04:53"

"Donald Trump","So we closed it up, we closed it up and then we opened it up, and we saved, I’ll tell you, we saved two million lives. It was 2.2 million people, were projected, we saved two million lives. But what happened, there shouldn’t have been one life. Shouldn’t have been. And we can never forget what China did to us, we can never forget. While foreign nations are in a free fall, you see what’s going on in other lands. Look at what’s happening in Europe. It’s a shame. We’re creating the world’s greatest economic powerhouse.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","05:34"
"Donald Trump","A recent Gallup Poll found that 56% of the Americans polled said that they were better off now, much better off, it’s a record, than they were four years ago under Obama and Biden. As president, I kept my promise. And I protected ethanol. And I approved E15 for use all year round. You don’t know what that means. That’s a lot. They’ve been trying to get that approved. Let me just tell you, for all of the ethanol people, and you have Joni, and you have Chuck over here, they fought with me. They were coming, they wanted it. And I said, “Can I give you just a little bit less.” “No, we won’t accept anything less.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","06:09"

"Donald Trump","You would have that terminated. You would have that terminated so fast. But authorized its use in existing gas pumps also, that doesn’t mean much to you, it means a lot to the ethanol people. So you have the existing gas pumps, you don’t have to go and spend a fortune to do the new gas pumps. Nobody knows that. And it doesn’t even sound very elegant in this speech. But you have the gas pumps to ethanol, and everything ends if Biden ever… It’s not going to happen with Biden, let’s face it. That’s not going to happen. That’s not going to happen.

The Biden Harris plan would outlaw American energy, would unleash economic misery for Iowa, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and every other state in America.

"Donald Trump","… if he was, I wouldn’t talk this way. He’s the only man that I’ve ever seen, his whole campaign is, “We will raise your taxes.” I said I’ve never heard of it. All my life I’ve watched politicians, I grew up with politicians, they’re always saying, “We’ll cut your taxes.” He’s the only guy I know that says, “We’re going to raise your taxes.” So I cut your taxes with them, the highest level cut in the history of our country. He wants to raise your taxes more than anybody has ever raised your taxes. Let me just ask you, how do you get elected? I mean, aside from right, wrong, how do you get elected? So he wants to give you the largest tax increase in history. Now for one year he went along the [inaudible 00:19:48] he had 27 people running, right? Some ran well, some didn’t go so good. Well, Kamala didn’t do well, she was dropping like a rock and she was mean to him.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","19:03"
"Donald Trump","And everybody’s against fracking, okay? It doesn’t pertain to you, but it does as your energy cost because you want your bills to be low, so he’s going, “No frack, no frack, no fracking. There will be no fracking.” We’ve got a little play. I don’t know if they put it, they did, we spent the money for Iowa, look, see that? That board is expensive as hell. Whoa. Hey, Iowa must be a very important place. We’ve got a little show. We’ve got a little show. Look how beautiful. You see a beautiful board, I see a lot of money was spent on that. Wait until you see it, it’s incredible what they can do for money, but you’re going to see it in a second. But he goes, “No fracking,” for a year. “No fracking, there will be no fracking.” So he said this 100 times and then he goes to Pennsylvania and he goes, “I believe in fracking. We will have fracking.” And the fake news, look at all of them back there, every one of them, they’re fake and they’re more fake now than they ever were.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","19:59"

I want to find out why did Moscow give where’s Hunter three and a half million? It must be his expertise. Where is Hunter by the way? Remember I said, “Where’s Hunter, is he here?” And then the next day they made a T-shirt. It was the number shirt of the year, where’s Hunter? No, but we want them to ask that question instead of what flavor ice cream are you having? They’ll terminate your school choice, eliminate your charter schools to fund religious schools, ban prayer in schools, indoctrinate your children, anti-American lies and force you to subsidize extreme late term abortion, that’s what they’re doing. That’s all in their platform, you got to read it. We call the manifesto between crazy Bernie, yeah, Bernie whose one of the greatest losers of all time. No, think of it. They stole two elections, not one. I’ve seen people where an election got stolen and by the way, we’re not going to let that happen to us with these ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","21:02"

Does this mean we go and we wait, so it’s not November 3rd, it’s going to be much later than that? No, no, we should know the result of the election on November 3rd, the evening of November 3rd. That’s the way it’s been and that’s the way it should be. What’s going on in this country? What’s going on? We believe that every child is a sacred gift from God. Biden and Harris will eliminate the private health insurance plans of 180 million Americans, their socialist takeover will ration care and force you onto endless wait lists. You’re going to have wait lists, you know what we’ve done by the way for the military has been incredible. We’ve gotten rid of the wait list for our veterans.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","22:16"

It’s ridiculous, I liked election day and most of you do too, who is going to vote on election day? Okay. And who’s already voted? Okay. And you sent ballots in? Be careful with the ballots, be careful. Just be careful with those ballots, I don’t know. Our opponents would pack the court, but remember, a lot of people have already been, he has never said if he’s going to pack the court, he’s getting along the tap, tap, he’s doing a little tap, tap, tap. So he has not said until he says he’s not going to do that, you can’t vote for him and then on top of it, I created a list of 25, now it’s 45 and we just got a great one approved, these two approved them. Amy is going to be fantastic, right? Amy, they all love Amy. She’s going to be a fantastic, for a long time a Justice of the Supreme Court, she’s going to be there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","23:14"
"Donald Trump","And we picked two other great ones and we’re very happy. We have three Justices of the Supreme Court. Many Presidents have never had a pick, they’ve never had a pick and I’ve had three, that’s just blowing their mind. Look, they’re saying, “How the hell did this happen? This guy is driving us crazy.” Well, the other thing we’ve done is, thank you to President Obama, he was unable to get anybody approved, he waited so long and we had little help too with the Senate to put it mildly, but he waited so long if you go early enough, you’ll get them through. And we ended up with 142 federal judges, but that’s nothing. So we’ll have, by the end of my first term, we’re going to have almost 300, could be more, 300 approximately 300 federal judges. So that’s 300 federal judges, three Justices of the United States Supreme Court. But Bernie never created a list, I have a list, so I take one from the list. People didn’t like it, they don’t vote for it because it’s they say the most important thing that a President does is Supreme Court Justices and judges. And he hasn’t given us the answer yet and he hasn’t given us a list and he can’t because they want far left maniacs and he won’t be able to get the votes. So you know what? He’s tapping you along, he doesn’t know he’s doing it, but he’s actually doing a very good job of it because people are voting and he still hasn’t given a list and he hasn’t said whether or not he’s going to pack the court. Look, nobody in this group is voting for this guy, nobody. He’s not qualified, he wasn’t Qualified in primetime, 25 years ago, he wasn’t qualified because he was never known as being the brightest bulb in the Lot. When it comes to your second amendment, they want to shred it. They want to abolish religious liberty and they want to ban God from the public square and you’ve seen that. So the Pledge of Allegiance during the Democrat convention, right? See, it’s supposed to be democratic, but it’s really not, it’s Democrat.

They had a typo maybe, we’ll call it a typo.” And then I heard it a second time.

And the first lady got it and Baron got it, now Barron’s a young guy, 14 and the doctor came to see me and he said, “Sir, your son tested positive.” I said, “For what?

Seriously, think of what China has done to the world. I had a group of people, not so long ago at a place, nice place. And they said, “President, President, could we say hello?” They’re wrapped in masks and it’s terrible. And they said, you couldn’t hear him because the mask.

He was the first one, I think, or just about, him and one other person. On day one, he said, this is four years ago, “You know that Trump is going to win, don’t you?” They said, “What do you mean?” He said, “Trump is going to win.” So in one way, can’t be so stupid, right? But the attorney general and the Governor of Minnesota said, “No, we can only allow 250 people.” We had 25,000 people that wanted to go. So I went there and they thought that I’d cancel for 250 people, because we’re drawing 25, 30, 40,000 people to every rally. So they figured I’d cancel.

Frankly, that was a much bigger statement than if we had the rally. If we had a rally, we would have had a big, beautiful rally, but it was a big statement. But between that and Omar, Ilhan Omar, she’s a real winner. Ilhan Omar, who obviously hates our country. She likes to tell us how to run our country. How the hell she gets elected anyways, hard to believe, but she’s in Minnesota. And the other thing is we stopped, I said, “You got to let the National Guard in,” they have to ask us, right? I said, “You got to let in the National Guard.” Well, a week and a half later, they let the National Guard in, and we stopped in, what would you say, 22 minutes? Remember, wasn’t that beautiful?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","42:52"
"Donald Trump","I mean, look, sometime, this week and a half they’re burning down Minneapolis, burning it down and CNN’s covering it. That reporter, he got hit on the knee with a canister of tear gas. [inaudible 00:06:00], he said, “I’m down, I got hit.” Don’t worry. It was only tear gas on the knee, he was down. But he was saying, “This is a friendly protest.” And you looked over his shoulder, right? The entire city was burning down. Did you see that? There’s a famous picture, the thing must’ve been like 10 blocks long. They should have called us sooner, but we put it out in about 15 minutes, maybe 20. That was a beautiful sight though, they just came in one, two, three, then all of a sudden more, more, you could just see the busloads. And they walked down that street with pepper spray and tear gas. And it was pow, pow. Everybody got, I’m telling you, less than a half an hour. It was all over. That thing lasted for two weeks.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","43:46"
"Donald Trump","Biden calls these lockdowns a dark winter. Wasn’t he inspiring at the debate? How bad was he? Look, I’ve debated guys that had intelligence. Look, I had a debate crooked Hillary four years ago, but I mean, at least she was as an intelligent person, she’s gone a little wacko. No, Hillary, you lost. Remember she said to me, “Will you respect the decision of the people?” And I sort of said, “Maybe.” I wasn’t perfect. I said, “Maybe, if there’s no cheating.” We have to be careful with cheating, right? But then she didn’t respect. And what did they do? They went on a witch hunt for years and years and they spied on my campaign and we caught them spying on the campaign. And now they say, “Will you respect the decision over the voters? And will there be a friendly transition?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","44:44"
"Donald Trump","First of all, there’s not going to be a transition, we’re winning. But then you say, then you say, “Well, let me ask you. Four years ago, was there a friendly transition?” They were spying on my campaign before I even won. And what was worse was they were spying on my campaign after I won, to overthrow the President of the United States, okay? Which is called treason, which is called treason. And let’s see what the hell happens. I don’t know why it takes so long, but it takes a long time. I’ll tell you that man right there, Chuck Grassley is one of the most effective people. He’s one of the people that, he’s one of the people that does not want to let them get away with it. And I appreciate it, you know that. No, he’s one of the most effective guys. He was the man. He looked at Comey. Remember when Comey lied in front of Congress? He looked at Comey, he said, “Did you leak?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","45:37"
"Donald Trump","Chuck is tough, when he’s talking regular he’s the toughest guy in the room. And Comey’s a liar. Worst Director in the history of the FBI, beyond the worst director. He was a bad guy. But Chuck Grassley is interviewing him, ask him. Then he looks at him, “One more question,” sort of like Columbo, right? I have one more question. Remember Columbo, hey, hey, hey, just one extra little question. So here he is, perry Mason also, always the last question, that was true. That was true during the debate, when he said the oil. I said, “Whoa, this is the biggest question of the night.” But with Chuck, he said, “Did you leak?” “What?” “Did you leak?” “Ah, yes. Yes I did.” And I’m sitting there saying, “I don’t believe this.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","46:36"
"Donald Trump","Oh, we love Chuck. What a piece of work Chuck is. What a piece of work that man is. I like that guy. He’s tough as hell though. It’s true. I guess I was only giving the ethanol guys 99%, and Chuck couldn’t stand that, he wanted them. He wanted you people to get 100%, right? I said, “Chuck, I’ve got the papers all ready to sign.” “I don’t like them.” “Why?” “You didn’t get that one little thing, that one little morsel for the other side.” A little morsel right for the other side. Happened to be the oil industry. I said, “Could we give them something?” And it wasn’t any good. We love you, man. We love you. He ended up getting a hundred percent.

"Donald Trump","The Biden lockdown will result in countless deaths, destroy millions in small businesses and wipe out an entire generation of hopes and dreams. Earlier today, one of his top advisors again confirmed their desire for a shutdown. The damage to children, you know that, you saw that, it was in the news. They want to shut it down. I don’t know. These people are crazy. We’ve got a thing that’s rocking and rolling. And it doesn’t work. The damage this will inflict on children, teenagers and young adults is absolutely cruel. The far left has always yearned to wield the unchecked power. That’s what they want is the power. I think it’s more than the power. I think it is the power and maybe the money. If you want a vaccine to kill the virus, a job to support your family, and freedom to live your life, then you cast your ballot for me and you have to do it on November 3rd.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","48:17"

We have some great people that want to come into government, and our nation has unbelievable potential. I didn’t watch much of Biden’s speech. He made a little speech, little tiny. He does very short speeches, very short, they’re the shortest speeches I’ve ever seen, actually. He just wants to go home to the basement. He doesn’t want to be. He is the most unhappy warrior I’ve ever. Did you ever see? He’s agitated, he’s just angry and agitated and he doesn’t want to be there. And now he’s starting to lose in the polls and it’s driving him crazy. So what does he do? He brings in Barack Hussein Obama and you know what happened to his attendance? It went down, his attendance, it actually brought it down.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","49:13"
"Donald Trump","They called and they said the other day, a couple of weeks ago, they said, “Sir, have a little bad news.” “What?” “Barack Hussein Obama is going to a campaign with Biden.” I said, “Why is that bad news? That’s good news. He campaigned with Hillary, and that was when she started really getting beaten.” Remember that? He campaigned. He’s a highly overrated person.

The ones that don’t call, they’re not as good, but we don’t want to tell them that. But she’s really considered one of the greatest governors in our country. And she’s a great person.

I hope he’s here. But he was your governor for 24 years. He set the record. And he told me a story.

We’ve known each other for 35 years.” So, Terry becomes governor again… 24 years. Longest serving governor in the history of the country. Okay. When you’re a governor for 24 years, that’s a long time. And I called him, in the middle of his term. I said, “Terry, they like you and China. President Xi has great respect for you. How would you like to be the ambassador to China,” and he said, “You know, sir, I think after 24 years, maybe it’s time.” And he represented us so well. He is so smart and so tough. And so we’re a… Come on up here, Terry. What a great job he’s done. So he wanted to come back, and he wanted to make sure that we get reelected. That’s what he wanted to do. But what a job he’s done.

He asked Xi if he would make all of Fentanyl a controlled substance, and it’s saving thousands of lives in America. He had the courage to put sanctions on the Chinese to get us a fair reciprocal trade agreement, which we’d never had before. And it’s already risen the price of corn a dollar a bushel. Soybeans are over $10. They made record purchases. We need a strong president, and Trump is the one that can do the job for the next four years.

And we have now the safest Southern border, and Joni and Chuck worked very much with me on that, and it’s been amazing. We really had a great success. That’s why you don’t hear about it anymore. That’s why you don’t hear about it anymore. They used to love it when they didn’t think we’d get it built. We had a hard time. That was a hard one. The Democrats were a wall.

We have the hypersonic missiles that go seven times faster than the world’s current fastest missile. And these were things that should have been done before me, but they didn’t decide to do that. So it’s one of those things. We passed VA Choice and VA Accountability for our veterans. Nobody thought that could be done. We took out 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria, and we killed the leader of ISIS Al-Baghdadi. They were looking for him for a long time.

We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults or law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend the right to life, religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms. Your Second Amendment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","01:08:53"
"Donald Trump","We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which is so good. Starts January 1st. Lower drug prices even more. We’re going favored nations. The drug companies are not in love with me. Favored nations. We’ll be paying the lowest drug prices anywhere in the world instead of the highest drug prices of the world. But the big pharma… I don’t even want to look at Chuck and Joni, because I have no idea if they’re… You know, the biggest lobbyists in the world, right? They spend more money. I can tell you, they’re making more commercials about me than sleepy Joe is, but we had to do it. Somebody had to do it. Only a non-politician would do that. And you pay a press, but we have to do the right thing. You’ll see a 50, 60, 70% reduction in drugs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","01:09:26"
"Donald Trump","And I got the only reduction last year. We got it down a little bit, one percent. It came down. It’s not that I’m bragging about it, but in 52 years… first time in 52 years the drug prices came down. So we’re sort of… I’m semi proud. At least it didn’t go up. I’m semi proud, but you’ll see what happens with what we’re doing with favored nations. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon in the United States. We’ll be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. It’s all done, our space center. NASA is incredible. It was a closed up, boarded up mess when we took over three and a half years ago. Now it’s, again, the envy of the world. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history and always respect our great American flag. Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","01:10:25"
"Donald Trump","And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America, and standing up for the great people of Iowa, and Wisconsin. And Wisconsin. We didn’t forget you, because you’re going to vote us in too. We’re going to be there very soon. We love Wisconsin. Wisconsin came through for us four years ago too, and we won’t forget that. To save the America we love. Get every last person you know… Get them to the voting booth in record numbers. Vote, vote, vote.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","01:11:32"
"Donald Trump","Join the red wave. We have a giant red wave that’s formed. It’s formed. It’s formed from Cambridge to Council Bluffs, to Cedar Rapids, to Rock Rapids, from Davenport to Dubuque. We inherit the legacy of American patriots who poured out their heart, sweat, and soul to secure our liberty and defend our freedom. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the ocean, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two World Wars, defeated fascism and communism, and made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world. And the best is yet to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","01:12:18"
"Donald Trump","Proud citizens like you help build this country, and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help… Thank you. Your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","01:13:14"
"Donald Trump","We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Iowa and Wisconsin back there, we have made America powerful again. Our military, our beautiful military. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-dubuque-iowa-november-1","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Dubuque, Iowa November 1","01:13:43"
