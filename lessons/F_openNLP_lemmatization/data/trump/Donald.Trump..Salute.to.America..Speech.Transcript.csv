"Donald Trump","Wow. You having a good time? Members of Congress, members of my cabinet, and my fellow Americans, the First Lady and I are delighted to welcome you to the second annual Salute to America. On this wonderful day, we celebrate our history, our heroes, our heritage, our great American flag, and our freedom. Happy 4th of July to everyone.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","00:24"
"Donald Trump","I want to thank the US Army Golden Knights for that truly awe-inspiring display, tremendous talent. The Golden Knights and every member of the Armed Forces here this evening, we just want to say that you have earned the eternal gratitude of our entire nation. 244 years ago in Philadelphia, the 56 signers of our Declaration of Independence pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to boldly proclaim this eternal truth that we are all made equal by God.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","01:09"
"Donald Trump","Thanks to the courage of those patriots on July 4th, 1776, the American Republic stands today as the greatest, most exceptional, and most virtuous nation in the history of the world. Our workers, our factories have revolutionized industries and lifted millions into prosperity. Our artists, architects, and engineers have inspired the globe with transcendent works of beauty. American heroes defeated the Nazis, dethroned the fascists, toppled the communists, saved American values, upheld American principles, and chased down the terrorists to the very ends of the earth.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","01:57"
"Donald Trump","We are now in the process of defeating the radical left, the Marxists, the anarchists, the agitators, the looters, and people who, in many instances, have absolutely no clue what they are doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","02:58"
"Donald Trump","Our inventors, scientists, doctors, and researchers have improved the lives of billions and billions of people all around the world. Our brave astronauts planted the American flag on the moon, and America will be the first nation to land on Mars.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","03:21"
"Donald Trump","All Americans living today are the heirs of this magnificent legacy. We are the descendants of the most daring and courageous people ever to walk on the face of the Earth. We inherit their towering confidence, unwavering enthusiasm, their unbridled ambition, and their unrelenting optimism. This is the untamed spirit that built this glorious nation, and this is the spirit that burns brightly within the soul of every American patriot.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","03:48"
"Donald Trump","That is why we pay tribute to generations of American heroes whose names have etched on our monuments and memorials and in the pages of history and in the hearts of a very grateful people. We will never allow an angry mob to tear down our statues, erase our history, indoctrinate our children, or trample on our freedoms. We will safeguard our values, traditions, customs, and beliefs. We will teach our children to cherish and adore their country so that they can build its future. Together we will fight for the American dream, and we will defend, protect, and preserve American way of life, which began in 1492 when Columbus discovered America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","04:34"
"Donald Trump","Jobs and companies are coming back to our country like never before. The power of tariffs being imposed on foreign lands that took advantage of the United States for decades and decades have enabled us to make great trade deals where there were none. Tens of billions of dollars are now paid to the United States Treasury by these same countries.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","05:46"
"Donald Trump","But there and then, we got hit by the virus that came from China. We’ve made a lot of progress. Our strategy is moving along well. It goes out in one area and rears back its ugly face in another area. But we’ve learned a lot. We’ve learned how to put out the flame. We’ve made ventilators where there were none by the tens of thousands, to the point that we have far more than we need, and we are now distributing them to many foreign countries as a gesture of good will. Likewise, testing. There were no test for a new virus, but now we have tested almost 40 million people. By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless, results that no other country can show because no other country has testing that we have, not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality. Now, just like everything else, we have become the manufacturer on record for ventilators. We have the most and finest testing anywhere in the world, and we are producing gowns and masks and surgical equipment in our country; where heretofore, it was almost exclusively made in foreign lands and-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","06:17"
"Donald Trump","It was almost exclusively made in foreign lands, in particular, China where, ironically, this virus and others came from. China’s secrecy, deceptions, and cover-up allowed it to spread all over the world, 189 countries, and China must be held fully accountable. With respect to remedies, we are now doing unbelievably well and are in deep testing on vaccines, treatments, and therapeutics.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","08:03"
"Donald Trump","I want to send our thanks to the scientists and researchers around the country and even around the world who are at the forefront of our historic effort to rapidly develop and deliver lifesaving treatments and ultimately, a vaccine. We are unleashing our nation’s scientific brilliance and will likely have a therapeutic and/or vaccine solution long before the end of the year. We’re very grateful to be joined this evening by Americans battling on the front lines to kill the virus. I just want to say that America thanks you. Please, stand. Please. Thank you very much. Great, brilliant people. These are great and brilliant people. Thank you. And brave people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","08:46"
"Donald Trump","Our movement is based on lifting all citizens to reach their fullest God-given potential. Never forget, we are one family and one nation. This rich heritage belongs to every citizen, young and old, first generation American. We want to go from first generation to 10th generation. It matters not. We are American. We are from the USA. This great heritage belongs to citizens of every background and of every walk of life. No matter our race, color, religion, or creed, we are one America, and we put America first.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","09:54"
"Donald Trump","We will not allow anyone to divide our citizens by race or background. We will not allow them to foment hate, discord, and distrust. We will hold fast and true to the sacred loyalties that link us all as neighbors, as Americans, and as patriots. In every age, there have always been those who seek to lie about the past in order to gain power in the present. Those that are lying about our history, those who want us to be ashamed of who we are are not interested in justice or in healing. Their goal is demolition. Our goal is not to destroy the greatest structure on earth, what we have built, the United States of America, to build a future where every family is safe, where every child is surrounded by love, where every community has equal opportunity and every citizen enjoys great and everlasting dignity.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","10:53"
"Donald Trump","Our past is not a burden to be cast away. It is not a miraculous foundation that will lift us to the next great summit of human endeavor. This incredible story of American progress is the story of each generation, picking up where the last finished, linked by time, by fate and the eternal bonds of our national affection. Those who would sever those bonds would cut us off from the wisdom, the courage, the love, and the devotion that gave us everything we are today and everything we strive for tomorrow. We cannot let that happen. We will not throw away our heroes. We will honor them, and we will prove worthy of their sacrifice. These are great heroes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","12:13"
"Donald Trump","Let me also say a word to those in the media who falsely and consistently label their opponents as racists, who condemn patriotic citizens who offer a clear and truthful defense of American unity. That’s what our people are doing. We want a clear and faithful defense of American history, and we want unity. When you level these false charges, you not only slander me, you not only slander the American people, but you slander generations of heroes who gave their lives for America. You slander people much braver and more principle than you. You’re slandering the young men who raised the flag at Iwo Jima and those who perished fighting for freedom in the Civil War. You slander them. You are dishonoring their great legacy and their memory by insisting that they fought for racism and they fought for oppression.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","13:24"
"Donald Trump","They didn’t fight for those things. They fought for the exact opposite. We will not let the legacy of these heroes be tarnished by you. The more you lie, the more you slander, the more you try to demean and divide, the more we will work hard to tell the truth, and we will win. The more you lie and demean and collude, the more credibility you lose. We want to bring the country together, and a free and open media will make this task a very easy one. Our country will be united after all. What do we all want? We want a strong military, great education, housing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","14:54"

We will honor extraordinary citizens from every community, and from every place and from every part of our nation. Great men and great women, people that we can look up to forever. Families will be able to walk among the statues of titans, and we have already selected the first 30 legacies and 30 legends, and why don’t we start with a man who’s been very unfairly treated, who twos years ago, three years ago, especially five or six years ago people would have said “It’s impossible to even attempt to try and disturb his incredible legacy and success?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","16:51"

We’re going to take names and suggestions, we’re going to have committees, and we’re going to pick the greatest people that this country has ever known, the most respected people, the people that helped us the most and the people that we can look up to and that our children and grandchildren and great grandchildren can look up to into the future and they can say “Isn’t America just a tremendous place?” So, thank you.

The beauty and the glory of our constitutional system is that it gives us the tools to fight injustice, to heal division and to continue the work of our founding fathers by expanding and growing the blessings of America. If you believe in justice, if you believe in freedom, if you believe in peace, then you must cherish the principles of our founding and the text of our constitution. It’s our founding and our constitution. It is a firm foundation upon which all progress is achieved.

We are joined by the outstanding law enforcement officers who have been able to fight on the front lines protecting our cities, many of them facing down violent assaults from very bad people. We are especially moved to be joined by the family of a great man, fallen officer David Dorn, a 38 year veteran of the St. Louis Police Department who was killed last month in the city he devoted his life to defending. And to David’s great family, I want to thank you very much.

We will honor the amazing men and women of the United States military. Never in history has a nation used so much power to advance so much good. Battlefields across the world and here at home are marked with the gravestones of young patriots who spent their final valiant moments on this earth to secure liberty and peace.

This will make our country even stronger, long into the future. In a few moments, we will bear witness to awesome aircraft representing every major military conflict over the last 75 years. These planes once launched off massive aircraft carriers in the fiercest battles of World War II. They raced through the skies of Korea’s MiG alley. They carried American warriors into the dense fields and jungles of Vietnam. They delivered a swift and swip…you know that, sweeping … It was swift and it was sweeping like nobody’s ever seen anything happen. A victory in Operation Desert Storm. A lot of you were involved in that. A lot of you were involved. That was a quick one. And they’ve gone on to dangerous missions all around the world to take out enemy terrorists and bring our soldiers home safely.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","25:39"

We’ve worked to fully rebuild the armed forces of the United States. No enemy on earth stands a chance. $2.5 trillion we’ve invested, all made in the USA. We’ve never had anything near the power and the equipment that we have right now. We did that over the last three years. Everywhere these aircraft have flown, they’ve rained down American thunder, delivered American justice, and they have fiercely defended every square inch of American sovereignty. In their steel frames, broad wings, and roaring engines, we see the story of America’s daring defiance, its soaring spirit, and undying resolve. Throughout our history, our country has been tested and tried, but we have always fought to victory. Whenever our way of life has been threatened, our ancestors have responded with the same resounding answer as those first patriots who fought for independence.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-salute-to-america-speech-transcript","Donald Trump “Salute to America” Speech Transcript","27:02"
