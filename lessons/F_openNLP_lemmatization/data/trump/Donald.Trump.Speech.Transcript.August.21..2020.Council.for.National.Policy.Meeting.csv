"President Donald Trump","You’re really fantastic and I want to thank you very much. You really are. Thank you very much. And thank you, Bill. And thank you to the Council for National Policy. My brother, Robert would have wanted me to be here today. Thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:58"
"President Donald Trump","Together we’re committed to protecting the American people, preserving American values, defending America’s heritage and keeping America safe, strong, prosperous, and free. I want to thank Bob McEwen, Kelly Shackelford and Jenny Beth Martin, for your tremendous leadership of the CNP, done a fantastic job. We’re also joined by acting secretary of Homeland Security, who’s done incredibly, Chad Wolf, where is Chad? Thank you very much, Chad. You’re right in the heart of it and got some big things coming, very big things. Good job. Also, Lieutenant Governor, friend of mine, Dan Patrick of Texas, Dan. Dan, wherever you may be. What a great guy, great family, great son, doing a tremendous job as US attorney. And many other state and local officials, I want to thank you all for being here, we have a lot of horsepower here, a lot of firepower you might want to say.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","02:20"
"President Donald Trump","But over the last week, the Democrats held the darkest and angriest and gloomiest convention in American history. They spent four straight days attacking America as racist and a horrible country that must be redeemed. Joe Biden grimly declared a season of American darkness and yet look at what we’ve accomplished until the plague came in, look at what we’ve accomplished. And now we’re doing it again. It’s most successful period of time in the history of our country, from every standard, look what we’ve accomplished. And now this plague comes in and look at the way they talk. But look at what’s happening and look at how we’re shooting up. We call it a super V, it’s no longer a V, it’s a super V and they didn’t think that could happen and they’re probably not happy about it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","03:38"
"President Donald Trump","They want to punish America and its citizens instead of holding them high, where Joe Biden sees American darkness, I see American greatness. We’ve seen heroic doctors and nurses racing into action to save lives. We’ve seen first responders helping strangers in need. We’ve seen the passage of historic legislation to save 50 million American jobs. We’ve mobilized American industry like never before. We’ve built military hospitals from scratch, produced life saving therapies, and we’re on track to develop the most incredible from a standpoint of time, record time, vaccines. We have vaccines. You’ll be reading about them very soon, way, way ahead of schedule, years ahead of schedule. This would have been where we are now, Phase 3 trials, clinical trials, you wouldn’t have been there in two or three years if you went back to another administration.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","04:35"
"President Donald Trump","It’s time to reject the anger and the hate of the Democrat Party, we have the biggest election coming up of our lifetime. No party can lead America that spends much time tearing down America. But the biggest part of last night’s speech was what Joe Biden didn’t talk about. He didn’t talk about law enforcement, he didn’t talk about bringing safety to Democrat run cities that are totally out of control and they have no clue. China was never mentioned in any way, shape or form. China will own our country if he gets elected, they will own our country. And we’re not going to let that happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","05:36"
"President Donald Trump","And you’ve seen the intelligence reports, China very much wants Joe Biden to win. That would be very insulting if they wanted me to win. I don’t think so. I don’t think so. We’ve taken in billions and billions of dollars from China. We’ve given it to our farmers. We’ve given it to a lot. They had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years, we had the best year we’ve ever had.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","06:24"
"President Donald Trump","We’ve demonstrated over the last four years the extraordinary gains that are possible while we stand strong for our beliefs, when we trust the wisdom of our founders and when we embrace America’s destiny, it’s a great destiny. With your help, we carried out the largest tax and regulation cuts, by far, in American history. And they now want to quadruple taxes and they want to quadruple and beyond the regulation cuts. And when we say tax and we say regulation, and you say, oh, tax cuts, that’s so wonderful, but the people in this room that are the heads of industry, you have some very powerful people in this room, they know that the regulation cuts may have been even more important than the biggest tax cuts we’ve ever had. To build a highway in this country could take in certain places, 18, 19, 20, even 21 years to get approved. It’s just not even thinkable. And we’ve got it now down to two and we’ll have it down to probably one and it may get rejected for safety reasons or for environmental reasons, that’s okay, it may happen. But we have it down, we will soon have it down to one year from as much as 21 years, we have cases that have just been disastrous. So I just wanted you to know some of the little details, but that’s what we’re working on. We’ll have it down to one year to build a highway. You can do it all in one year, it doesn’t have to take 21 years and cost a hundred times more, literally, I’ve seen a hundred times more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","06:58"
"President Donald Trump","We eliminated Obamacare’s unfair individual mandate penalty, which is really the elimination of Obamacare. And to give to critically ill patients access to lifesaving drugs, we passed a thing called and hopefully nobody in his room will need it, but if you do it’s Right to Try, we have the greatest medicines, the greatest doctors and labs in the world and we have things that won’t be approved by the FDA for a little while, although I’ve cut that time now down in half. Used to be 12 years, now we’ve cut it down more than half. And you see that with the vaccines, you see it with the therapeutics. But Right to Try, where we have the right to now go in and use some of these very promising drugs and the response has been unbelievable. What’s happened and the lives saved have been really incredible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","08:53"
"President Donald Trump","People used to leave for Asia. They used to leave for Europe. They used to leave for other places all over the world, or they’d go home and die. They’d go home and dive. If they had no money, they’d go home and die, which is most people. Now they sign a very short, simple document and they have the Right to Try and it’s given them hope and in many cases, it’s given their life back. So it’s been a great thing. These are things that nobody talks about that, but they’ve been trying to get that approved, by the way, not as easy as it sounds. It’s complicated because you have the insurance companies and the doctors and the hospitals and the country itself doesn’t want to get sued. And so it’s not very easy, but they’ve been trying to get it approved for 41 years, they’ve been trying to get that, that’s just one of many, many things that we’ve done, for 41 years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","09:47"
"President Donald Trump","To provide our amazing veterans the care they deserve, we passed VA Accountability and VA Choice. Many, many decades they’ve been trying to get that. Choice meaning you wait in line and you can’t see a doctor and they would wait in line for a week or two weeks or five weeks, sometimes they’d be ill and they’d end up being terminally ill by the time they saw the doctor and we’re letting them go out and get a private doctor immediately and we pay the bill. And we just got a 91% approval rating in the VA, the highest we’ve ever had by many points, 91%. VA Accountability sounds simple, but it’s not. You couldn’t let anybody go, no matter how they disrespected our great vets, no matter what they said to them, no matter how badly they treated them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","10:41"
"President Donald Trump","And we had sadists and we had thieves, we had a lot of bad people. You couldn’t fire them under any circumstances, under any circumstance you couldn’t fire them. And now we say, “You. You’re fired.” It’s called VA Accountability and they’ve wanted to have that. Actually they’ve let go of 9,000 people, replaced them with people that love our vets, want to take care of our vets, great people and we had a terrible thing going, you couldn’t get them fired because of civil service and unions and different things. You couldn’t fire them, now you can fire them, you can fire them quickly if they’re not doing the job. It’s a big deal and we don’t talk about it a lot, nobody talks about it, but they’ve been trying to get those two things approved for more than four decades and now they’re done and they’re approved.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","11:35"
"President Donald Trump","We ended the Obama/Biden administration’s war on American energy. And the United States is now the leading producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. It’s a big thing. And remember this, if you look at what they’re doing, Biden, he wants to end fracking, end petroleum products, end petroleum, no natural gas, no nothing, end everything. And that’s it. How does that work in Texas? How does that work in Pennsylvania?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","12:25"
"President Donald Trump","I was in Pennsylvania yesterday. A place that he said he was born in, which is true, but he left when he was like nine years old. So he left a long time ago, he left seven decades ago and he still calls it his home. And his real home is a place he never leaves anymore, never leaves. Never leaves the outskirts of that state. You’d think he’d go a little bit, it’s not that far. Never leaves. We’ll figure it out pretty soon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","13:06"
"President Donald Trump","But they want to end fracking, they want to end drilling, they want to end everything, they want to end all of this. So I said, think of it, they want to end oil, they want to end, and this is the way it is, guns, they want to take away Second Amendment. Right? How about that? That alone should win you the election. That alone.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","13:51"

"President Donald Trump","And I protect your Second Amendment and you think that was easy for the last four years? Everyone’s, “Oh, look, he’s wilting. He’s wilting.” And no, we’re not welting. We’ve had people that were in tragedies and they lost a son in school and they lost a daughter, beautiful Meadow. And that gentleman has been a friend of mine, he knows exactly who I’m talking about. Beautiful Meadow, they’re totally in favor, they’ve actually gotten hard line on Second Amendment, it’s not one way. It’s a incredible thing to see actually. But we held totally strong and it’s always going to be with us. But if they get in, they will absolutely either obliterate it to a point of no return or actually terminate it and I have no doubt about it. I have absolutely no doubt about it. And it’s something we can’t let happen, such a big part of our security and our safety and your entertainment and all, but I say security and safety probably first, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","14:45"
"President Donald Trump","And God, it’s an attack on God. It’s an attack on religion. Did you see the man that got up and saying a very, very special phrase from a very, very special thing? And he left the word God out and I was watching and I said, “Oh, he must’ve made a mistake.” I didn’t think that he left it out, I thought maybe he… You know, that can happen, maybe he made a mistake. He didn’t make a mistake, that’s where they’re coming from. He left the word God out and that’s where they’re coming from.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","15:45"
"President Donald Trump","I withdrew from the one sided Paris… If you see it, the Paris Climate, I call it the Paris Climate Disaster. This was a way of taking advantage of the United States. We wouldn’t be able to drill, we wouldn’t be able to frack, we wouldn’t have energy. Russia went way back into the dirtiest years, China didn’t even come into it until 2030 or 2035 and when they did, they came in very lightly. We came in immediately and we would have had to close down many, many businesses in order to achieve the goals that they set, which are totally unrealistic. It was a disaster.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","16:18"
"President Donald Trump","And you know, it’s an amazing thing, when I did that and when I did a couple of others, environmental bills, the Clean Waters Act how about that? That sounds so beautiful. The name is so beautiful. In fact, when I did it, I said, I’m going to be killed on this one, and I did it. And I was surrounded by farmers and developers, builders that built houses and others and they never cried, they’re very strong people, they never cried a day in their life. They were almost all crying.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","17:03"
"President Donald Trump","There was a big strong guy, I said, “When was the last time you cried?” “I can’t remember, sir.” I gave them back their life. That took away their life. And what we did in Minnesota with the iron ore, people up to me, they said, “You gave us back our life, Obama wrote it out.” Iron ore, the best in the world. He wrote it out. We gave it back to them. We went up to Maine, we gave them back their lobsters, we gave them back their fishing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","17:32"
"President Donald Trump","We gave them back their lobsters. We gave them back their fishing. 5,000 square miles. Think of what that is. Take one mile, mile by mile, and now you add five. As big as the ocean is, that was a big chunk right off the coast of Maine. Their whole thing is lobsters and fishing, and nobody does it better. And they were not allowed. It was a monument, called a monument. I said, “A monument to what?” I said when I was up in Maine two weeks ago, I said to people that their whole life was lobster, fishing, the different things, and they’re the best. I said, “What happened?” They said, “He took away our everything.” I said, “How does this area compare to other areas?” He said, “First of all, it takes a long time to get to the other areas. This is so big. But second of all, this is the best there is in the world and he doesn’t let us use it.” And I said, “And yet, you vote Democrat and [crosstalk 00:00:19:14].” It’s like Israel. Look what I did for Israel.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","18:03"
"President Donald Trump","Thank you. But it’s amazing to me because nobody’s been worse to Israel than President Obama and Biden, nobody. Nobody’s been worse. Look at the Iran deal, it’s the worst thing that ever happened to Israel. And they never moved the embassy to Jerusalem thereby making Jerusalem the capital of Israel, which I did. And neither did any other president. And I understand why. They campaign on it, campaign. Every president said they were going to do it, no president did it until I came along. And I will tell you, the pressure from other parts of the world was enormous.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","19:24"
"President Donald Trump","And I’ve told the story a few times where I just turned off my phone and when the king calls and this one calls and that one calls, “We’re calling about Israel.” I say, “Tell them I’ll get back in a couple of days. I’ll get back in a couple of days. I’ll be in next week.” Kings and queens and prime ministers and presidents and dictators, everybody was calling. “Don’t do it. Don’t do it. It’ll be bloodshed all over the Middle East.” Look what we just did, right? With the United Arab Emirates and Israel. And now others will follow. And we couldn’t have done that if we had the deal with Iran. But they said, “Don’t do it, don’t do it with Israel. Don’t do it.” And I didn’t take that call. And I did it, had a ceremony. It was fine. Nothing happened. Remember? The world was going to blow up. This will be the end of the world. So I held my breath and I did it. And you know what happened? Nothing. Except we did something that should have been done many, many decades ago. And every president violated their promise, their campaign promise, except for me. And I did it. And by the way, I added in Golan Heights. That was a big one too, by itself. And I did it. And it’s incredible. I then call up these heads of state, many of whom are friends of mine, I get along. Actually, you don’t hear this from the fake news back there, oh, there’s a lot of press, a lot of press. But you don’t hear this from the people back there, but I actually have very good relationships with leaders, with many of them. And some of them just take too much advantage of our country, including some of our so-called allies. Some of them are the worst for taking advantage of us, but you don’t hear that. So what I did is I called some of the leaders the following week. “Hi, how you doing? What’s up?” “Oh, we wanted to talk to you about Israel, but you already did it.” I said, “Oh, I wish I got to you a little bit sooner.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","20:19"
"President Donald Trump","But that’s easier than having somebody asking you over and over, “Please don’t do it.” But I could see there was a lot of pressure. I never understood why it wasn’t done it. It wasn’t done because there’s tremendous pressure put on the President of the United States by many other countries, much more than you would think, and different countries than you would even think. Countries that you wouldn’t think even cared about it were calling, asking not to do it. So we did it and it’s been really quite historic, I guess. And I could run in Israel and I think they said I’m probably a 98% approval rating in Israel. It’s been great. And you know who appreciates it the most are the evangelical Christians. They appreciate it the most.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","22:35"
"President Donald Trump","That has been, just by itself, that’s one thing out of many, many things, but that’s been quite an interesting journey. But we also took historic action to stand up to China’s trade cheating and plundering. You know that? We had the best year we ever had and they’ve had the worst year they’ve had in 67 years. I wonder why. And I don’t want them to have bad years, but there’s been nobody that has ripped off the United States like China for so many years, how presidents before me allowed that to happen. And especially the one just before me. And Joe Biden with his son walking out with $1.5 billion to manage, meaning millions of dollars a year in fees, is a disgrace. That guy, he’s a disgrace.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","23:36"
"President Donald Trump","And then the vast sums of money he was paid by a Ukrainian company that didn’t have the highest standing, to put it mildly, but the vast sums of money. If that ever happened to a Republican, they would have been in jail a long time ago. It’s such a double standard. I can’t tell you. This whole thing with all of the things that happened, the deep state, you can believe it, you don’t have to believe it, but it’s very unfair. And I will say that if a Republican ever did what Joe Biden did with calling off the prosecutors or you’re not going to get a billion dollars, and he’s on tape. It’s not like, “Oh, gee.” I mean, he’s on tape. We wouldn’t have had a chance. It’s a disgrace. The double standard is a disgrace. And hopefully it’ll be brought back to fairness.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","24:28"
"President Donald Trump","And remember this, they spied on my campaign and they got caught. They can say what they want. This FBI agent has just now, first one, admitted. That’s the beginning, hopefully, of the falling castle. But he’s admitted that he forged documents. He changed documents, reversing them, and he admitted it. So let’s see what’s going to happen over the next, hopefully, short period of time. Because it’s been unfair that we’ve had to wait so long. That was so obvious for a long time, and it should never be allowed to happen to another president again. That I can tell you. And that’s for the good of the country. Not for me, for the good of the country. Within three years, we replaced NAFTA, which everybody said was impossible to do, with a brand new and really pro-America USMCA. It’s a whole different ball game. And we don’t want to lose our companies to Mexico and Canada. And this puts a tremendous price tag on doing that. If they want to do that, they won’t be doing that. In everything we do, my administration is fighting for the American people and delivering one victory after another. We have appointed more than 230 federal judges. We expect to be perhaps over 300 federal judges by the end of the year. Thank you. I can tell you it’s driving them crazy. Don’t forget President Obama. They say he was a great president. Well, you can’t be a great president when much of what he’s done we’ve undone. And you can’t be a great president when you leave 142 empty judgeships. I don’t think any president’s left any. These are very, very important things for a party. Different policies, different everything. You understand it better than anybody, the people in this room. Left us 142. First day in office, I said, “How many judges do I have to appoint?” “Sir, you have 142.” I said, “You have to be kidding. 140.” So I had a big headstart. But we have 142. But now we will have, I think, in excess, by the time we finish, in excess of 300, including Court of Appeals. And of course, two very exceptional Supreme Court justices. So good, really good. And remember this in terms of get out the vote. The next president, I think, could have anywhere from two to four to maybe even five, just based on statistics, statistically, Supreme Court justices to pick. Think of that. I’ve had two. Some presidents have had none because you generally pick them young and they last a long time, right? They can last a long time. But we could have two to three to four, maybe even to five. It’s probably a stretch, but four isn’t a stretch at all. That would mean that the entire balance of the court doesn’t just shift, it becomes dominant. So if we don’t win, which we don’t want to think about, we have to think positively, and the polls today, Rasmussen, 51%. And they were the ones that got it right last time, them and a few others. 51%. They don’t want to show those. They only want to show those polls, not likely voters, registered voters. What does that mean? Many are dead. Many have switched their party affiliations. Registered, they don’t show likely. But you see some of these polls where they interview many more Democrats than Republicans. And they have to, I guess, by law, they interviewed. But many more. And they don’t go likely. Why don’t they do likely voters? Because I think they’d be very upset. I think they know they’d be very upset. Bottom line, we’re doing very well. We have the biggest crowds. I think there’s more enthusiasm now for this election than there was even, it’s record enthusiasm, by the way, record setting enthusiasm right now, it’s more now than we had even four years ago. Does that make sense?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","25:18"
"President Donald Trump","And we had the same thing four years ago where they say … But now we’ve done so much. This is easier in many ways. We were sailing. By the way, without the plague from China, this thing was over. This was over, we were sailing. But that came in and then you have to prove yourself again. So now I have to prove myself again, but we’re doing that. We’re building up the economy. We’re way ahead, by every poll, even the fake polls, we’re way ahead on the economy, which is very important. But we are. I mean, think of it. You prove yourself, you’re in this, and now you have to do it again. But that’s what we’re doing. We have the V, we have the super V we can talk about.

But I don’t think anybody, with the possible exception of Abraham Lincoln, but nobody’s done more. If you look at opportunity zones, you look at all of the things we’ve done, nobody’s done more. After years of neglect by both parties, my administration understands that a strong nation must have strong borders. By next week, we will have gone up to over, as I say, 300 miles. That’s hard to believe. And that was tough. They didn’t want it. Do you notice now that we’re building it you don’t hear about it anymore? They don’t want to talk about it anymore.

No matter with all the technology and all the changes you see, you don’t recognize a computer from five years ago, it’s not even recognizable, two things don’t change, right? Walls and wheels. And you can come back in 2000 years from now and two things will still be around, wheels and walls. Remember when they were saying the wall doesn’t do anything? They wanted to have a drone flying around, flying around to join so you could watch everybody pour into our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","31:53"
"President Donald Trump","We’ve ended catch and release, one of the great scams of all time. We catch them and release them. They should say catch and release into our country because you catch them and then you release them and you weren’t allowed to bring them back. Now we bring them back. We absolutely bring them back. We’ve dismantled drug smuggling and human trafficking. These networks are horrible. Human trafficking in women. Which has turned out, you think of it as almost an ancient crime, but it’s not. It’s bigger now all over the world than it’s ever been because of the computer, because of the internet. It’s bigger now than ever before. It’s a horrible thing. Much of it through the southern border, but all over the world this is taking place. And we’ve brought it down to levels that nobody thought even possible. But it’s a terrible thing. Mostly trafficking in women. Children to a lesser extent, but women.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","32:26"

And their countries, under the Obama administration, didn’t want to take people. You know that, right? They didn’t want to take them. They said, “No, don’t bring them back here. We’re not taking them.” Guatemala, El Salvador, right? Honduras. They wouldn’t take people back. Now they take them back.

"President Donald Trump","The last administration left us with a Middle East in chaos. This was a Middle East in chaos. Iran was empowered and exporting terror. They don’t have too much money now. They’re not spending billions of dollars giving it to Al Qaeda, Hezbollah, some of these wonderful groups that are totally vicious, crazed lunatics. But Iran is different. It’s having a hard time. It’s GDP went down at a level that you wouldn’t even believe, in the 20s. And they’ll make a deal. I say they’ll make a deal within a month, but I probably mean a week. But I just want to be right. Because they’ll call me. They’ll say, “It took 10 days. He was wrong.” They just want to see. If I win, they’ll be in making a deal. And if for some reason I don’t, they’ll take their time and they will get one of the great deals since the last one where we paid them 150 billion. Billion. Gave them 150 for nothing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","33:50"
"President Donald Trump","It wasn’t even a long term deal. You know, right now, the time is almost up. This was a short term deal. It’s like you rent a store in a shopping center. These are countries we’re dealing with. You need length, but it was a short term deal. But more important, we gave them 1.8 billion in cash. Think of that. Cash, cash. We flew it in in Boeing 757s loaded from floor to ceiling with cash. What were these people thinking? And had I kept that deal, we terminated that deal, had I kept that deal, we could never have started this incredible thing that’s happening with UAE, Israel. And everybody’s saying, “Why haven’t you invited us?” Okay. Many countries now want to come in.

"President Donald Trump","I can’t even believe it. I’m surprised they did it. I’m sure they’ve changed it by now. Somebody got in, they said, “Who wrote that editorial?” They probably lost their job. But Tom Friedman actually wrote the editorial. It was very fair. It’s true. He couldn’t believe it. It’s gotten great reviews from everybody. Wall Street Journal, Washington Post. Can you believe that one? Everybody gave it and we couldn’t have done that deal had we stayed in this horrible deal done by John Kerry who just had no clue as to negotiation. He never got out. They would tell him, ” We want this. We want this. We want this.” And he’d sit there and he’d agree to everything. Sometimes you have to get up and walk. He never got up and walked.

He had insignias like he was a 20 year old great cyclist from France. So that delayed him about two months. They said, “He just got hurt in a bicycle accident.” What? It’s not a good accident when you … So I promised I wouldn’t do that.

"President Donald Trump","But if you look at the Obama Administration, ISIS was rampaging all over. I’ve defeated 100% of the ISIS caliphate in Iraq and Syria. Yesterday we had the Prime Minister of Iraq in my office and he made a statement. He said, “Sir, I want to thank you. You have defeated ISIS.” I said, “Wait a minute. You say that. Nobody ever says that. Those people back there don’t say it. What do you mean by that?” He said, “You.” I said, “Do you mean Obama? Do you mean the United States?” “Sir, Obama, it was a disaster. When you took over ISIS was in 30% of our country. You came in and you defeated.” I said, “Will you please go public with that?” So he said, “I would,” he would. But it’s true. I mean, we defeated 100% of the caliphate and we turned it all around. We rebuilt the United States military, $2.5 trillion. We have a brand new beautiful military. And as I said with Israel, we got out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, which was such a horrible thing for Israel. But I asked a friend of mine, who’s a big fan of Israel, I said, “So what was the best? Golan Heights, Jerusalem capital? What was more important of the two?” Golan Heights, which they’ve been working on for 52 years, recognition of Golan Heights for Israel. 52 years, planes would fly in. They’d have summits every year or two, planes would fly in. They’d talk, they’d talk and keep talking. Two days later, the planes would fly out. Then they’d meet two years later. 52 years, they went through that. I got it done immediately. I said, “Which is more important, Golan Heights or Jerusalem Capitol?” I said, “Neither.” I said, “What do you mean neither?” He said, “The most important is when you withdrew from that horrible and very dangerous Iran Nuclear Deal. That was the greatest thing you did for Israel.” It’s very interesting. And I said, “I agree.” I actually said, “I agree.” We imposed the toughest ever US sanctions in Iran. And this week we invoked the snapback provisions to restore virtually all of the previously suspended UN sanctions. We snapped it back. It’s a good term. The founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, is dead. We killed him. And the world’s top terrorist, probably over 50 years the top terrorist, Qasem Soleimani, is dead. He’s gone.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","37:15"
"President Donald Trump","But the more success that we’ve achieved, the more unhinged the radical left has become. Anarchists and violent mobs have rioted in our Democrat run cities, attacking our police and tearing down statues. And as you know, I signed a clause. I got an old bill, you know when they used to do powerful things, when they knew what the hell they were doing. I took an old bill and I gave a nice, beautiful brand new executive order. It says very easily, could you imagine getting this today? You rip down a statue, a federal statute, you go to jail, prison, they use the term prison. You go to prison for 10 years.

"President Donald Trump","And I remember there was a big march on Washington. They were coming in to knock a lot of statues down. They even had a Thomas Jefferson plan. That was in their planning. No thanks. George Washington. They were even thinking about Lincoln. Lincoln did sort of a pretty good job, right? But they were talking about anybody. I don’t even know if they knew what they were doing. They’re just wild and out of control. But I signed this 10 years in prison if you knocked down a statue. We have people right now in jail that are going to trial by the way. And that was from previous [inaudible 00:05:38].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","40:58"
"President Donald Trump","But if you remember, that was a big thing two and a half months ago. You know when I signed it? Two and a half months ago. Two and a half months ago I signed it. We haven’t had a problem since. They say, “We want to knock down that statute, but 10 years. Let’s say. 10 years. That’s a lot of time. That’s a lot of time.” Which tells you that laws, if properly utilized, can stop all of this madness. And that’s why we have to give our great police back their dignity and their power. I’ve been endorsed by almost every police organization in the country. We just got the other day, Pat Lynch, the head of New York City Police, endorsed me. First endorsement he said, to the best of his knowledge, which is a lot of knowledge, the first time they’ve ever endorsed a candidate for president. That’s good. They don’t endorse. The first time ever. All the sheriffs in Florida. Dan can tell you all of the law enforcement in Texas, right? All of the law enforcement in Texas, Dan. So it’s good. And just about everywhere.

But you have bad apples. But these are great people that do a phenomenal job that actually are appreciated by the public. By the public they’re appreciated and they’re loved and they’re respected and the public doesn’t want to happen what’s happening to our police. They took away their dignity. They took away their right to do the job that they want to do. And they’re doing the job now. And for me, they do the job. You look at most cities in our country, crime is actually down. You look at Chicago and you say, “How’s that possible?” You look at New York, what’s happened just in a short period of time, but we’re with them and they’re with us and they’ve done a fantastic job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","43:06"

I might say radical left Democrat in some cases. But these are people that don’t have any clue what they’re doing. They have no idea. I don’t even think they know that it’s bad what’s going on. You know, you’d almost say they’re trying to defend it. It’s incredible to hear them. But that’s why I launched Operation Legend, which has led to the arrest of 1,500 criminals since July. And the radical left spent four years trying to illegally overturn the last election. They’re still trying to overturn. Hillary Clinton, remember the Hillary Clinton. “Will you honor the election, the results of the election?” That was Hillary Clinton. And she should have asked that question to herself.

They want to pack the court with radical left justices, abolish the filibuster, which frankly, I wish we did it because I said, “They’re going to do it. So we might as well get there first.” But I couldn’t get a couple of people to go along with me, but my attitude was, “Schumer’s going to do it.” They all said, “No, he’ll never do that. He’ll never do it.” Guess what? They’re doing it. They’re doing it. And as much as we’ve done, we’ve done more than anybody has ever done in three and a half years. But you know what? As much as we’ve done, we would’ve done more had we done that, because getting those extra 10 votes was almost impossible with these people. Almost impossible. So I wish we had done it.

You have it on driver’s licenses. You have on everything just about. And the only one they don’t want it on is a vote, which the most important thing you have is your vote and they don’t want it. We have it in some states, Indiana, we have some great really voter ID. They want to abolish it where it is and never allow it to happen again. And that’s only a bad thing. That’s only a bad thing.

Portland has good police, but again, they’re not allowed to do their job. If our opponents prevail, no one will be safe in our country and no one will be spared.

This is going to happen. And the radical left will bring him along so quickly. I don’t know if you saw the Congress woman the other day where she said, “He will do whatever I tell him to do. He’s perfect. He will do whatever I tell him to do.” This is a Congresswoman. And Bernie Sanders is saying the same thing. Bernie Sanders is saying, “Look, we’ll just let him be in there.

"President Donald Trump","I really don’t think that you’re going to know anything on the evening, anything meaningful or anything real on the evening of November 3rd. I don’t think you’re going to know anything. You’re not going to know what happened. I don’t think you’ll two weeks later. I don’t think you’ll know four weeks later. And I don’t know what’s going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","57:12"
"President Donald Trump","You know, there’s a theory that if you don’t have it by the end of the year, crazy Nancy Pelosi would become president. You know that, right? No, no, think of that. Think of that. There’s that mad theory too. You have heard that theory. Now I don’t know if it’s a theory or a fact, but I said, “That’s not good. That’s not good.” No, no. There is a theory that if you don’t have it, and that’s part of their whole act, that if you don’t have a choice, that the Speaker of the House becomes president. And that, I think, goes into effect either on the 20th or the first, and put that in the hopper, add that to everything else. It’s a disgrace.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","57:31"
"President Donald Trump","They know it’s filthy dirty. Patterson New Jersey, Virginia, New York, many, many cases all over the country. Just recent, I’m talking about recently. And it’s not even the post office, although the mailmen become very popular people, I have to tell you that. That’s happened too. That’s happened too. Even mailmen. But think about what they’re doing to our country when they do this. We voted in World War I. We voted in World War II. And now we can’t vote anymore.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","58:16"
"President Donald Trump","And that’s still a long time away. The pandemic is … if you look at Florida, if you look at Arizona, you look at California, those numbers are going down very rapidly. Many, many states have very little problem. You look at a map now, it’s largely really in good shape. I mean, I’m going to talk about it in my speech on Thursday. We’ve done a great job. We have not been recognized for what we’ve done. We’ve done a great job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","58:50"
"President Donald Trump","So in two and a half months from now, we’ll be in good shape. And we’re going to be in really, I think, potentially really good shape. And we can’t let this happen to our country. It’s called universal mail-ins, okay. They like the word universal, ’cause it explains it. I don’t know why. I personally don’t like the name. I just call it mail-in. But we want to distinguish it from absentee voting, which is okay, which has gone on for a long time. And we’re prepared for that. But we’re not prepared for this 51 million ballots. It will be a tremendous embarrassment to our country. It’ll go on forever, and you’ll never know who won. So I say that for you. I say it for the cameras, because I assume that goes out. But I will tell you that this is a very serious problem for a great democracy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","59:20"
"President Donald Trump","This is a very, very serious problem. And something has to be done about it. And they’re being sent almost as we speak. People are going to get ballots that had no intention of voting, that may be shouldn’t be voting. That may be aren’t. And they’d say the computers will pick it up. The computers are going to pick up nothing. They’re going to pick up nothing. You’ll have double voting, where they send in a ballot and then they’ll go and vote. That’s going to be a big problem. They’ll send in their ballot and then they’ll vote too. They’ll send in the ballot and then they’ll vote. What are the chances that some state’s so efficiently run? “Oh gee, you can’t vote. We just got your ballot last night at 7:00.” I mean, think of how ridiculous it is, right, common sense. I say this for the media. This will be the greatest catastrophe, one of the greatest catastrophes in the history of our country. That’s how serious it is. And they also think I’m trying to steal an election, just the opposite. I want the fair results of an election.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:00:11"
"President Donald Trump","So the damage that they inflict will not just last a year or an election cycle, it will echo for generations, and we may never be able to escape, no matter how great our future leaders. We may never, ever escape from the damage that will be inflicted if the radical left takes over the presidency. We may never be able to. Remember the Supreme Court, but we may never be able to do it. It’ll be too late. The country will go down so far that you’ll never ever, I don’t care who you are, be able to bring it back.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:01:15"
"President Donald Trump","There’s now a major American political party that supports decriminalizing illegal border crossings, abolishing cash bail. You kill somebody, no bail. They want to close all prisons, outlaw American energy, confiscate your guns, force taxpayers to finance late term abortion. They want to ban charter schools, abolish school choice, destroy our beautiful suburbs. I have done more for suburbia, where they talk about the suburban woman, “Will she vote for Trump?” If she doesn’t, I mean, what is she doing? They want to force low income housing into suburbia. And now the one that wants to do it is Cory Booker.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:01:50"
"President Donald Trump","Cory Booker’s a disaster. You saw him running for president. He eventually quit when he started getting below 1%. How about all these people? How about Kamala? Kamala runs, she’s sort of one of the favorites. And she goes from 15 to 13 to 12 to nine to seven, five, four. About one, she got out. She didn’t even get to Iowa. She never got there. She didn’t want to take a vote. That’s how bad she was. Don’t you want to pick a person that’s gone in the opposite direction? I mean, seriously. That’s like a free poll. But there’s something that’s not good going on there. I don’t think it was a good choice. It was my number one draft pick. I did say that. They said, “How do you like the choice?” I said, “That was my number one draft pick.” But I meant from my standpoint. But think of it. She was one of the favorites and she went down like a rock. So it’s one of those things.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:02:47"
"President Donald Trump","I believe one of the worst things going on now is the abolition of police, or even the partial abolition of police. So we have to expose this dangerous left-wing movement. We must defeat it, and with an optimistic vision for America’s future, we can be greater than ever before. We will be greater than ever before. With your help, that’s exactly what we’re going to do. We’ll once again build the greatest economy in history. We had it. We had to let it go to save millions of lives, and now we’re building it again. We’ll fully restore America’s manufacturing independence, bring home our critical supply chains, and permanently end our reliance on China.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:03:51"
"President Donald Trump","We’re going to lower drug prices. We’re going to lower drug prices at a level that’s never been lowered before. I’m the only president in 51 years that lowered last year, drug prices went down a little bit, not much, but a little bit. But under Obama and Biden, they went up 52%. We’ll create a healthcare system that protects vulnerable patients, lowers costs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:04:38"
"President Donald Trump","We have transparency. It’s already done. It’s approved. It kicks into effect in January.

"President Donald Trump","We’ll provide school choice to every parent in America. We’ll appoint more conservative judges and justices.

"President Donald Trump","We’ll restore patriotic education to our schools. I mean, what they’re teaching students today is incredible. They come home, it’s like a different world. What is it? 1619 now, all of a sudden they changed. Now they’re thinking about making another change, because they don’t like that. But I don’t know. So I guess, 1492 Columbus discovered America. And that’s what we all … 1492 Columbus discovered America. That’s what it was. Now they want to get that, and poor Columbus. They’re ripping those … poor Christopher.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-transcript-august-21-2020-council-for-national-policy-meeting","Donald Trump Speech Transcript August 21: 2020 Council for National Policy Meeting","01:06:08"
"President Donald Trump","Except in one tough Italian neighborhood in New York, they didn’t get away with it. Did you see that? Did you see it? The anarchists said, “Let’s get the hell out of here. This is dangerous.” The anarchists left. That was one very tough, great area. We love that area. I know it very well. They started surrounding it. They were all set. They had the ropes going, the whole deal. And all of a sudden they said, “Let’s get out of here.” Great. Christopher Columbus, can you believe it? Christopher Columbus. We will restore patriotic education to our schools and teach our children to love their country, honor our history, and respect our great American flag.
