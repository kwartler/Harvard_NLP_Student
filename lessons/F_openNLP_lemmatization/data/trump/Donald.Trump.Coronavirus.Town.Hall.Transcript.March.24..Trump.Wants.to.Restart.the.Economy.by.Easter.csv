"Harris Faulkner","And I’m Harris Faulkner in New York. The administration’s 15 day plan, you saw the Vice President holding that up several times. The plan is to curb the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and it’s set to expire in less than a week from today.

"Bill Hemmer","To you, Mr. President, when was the moment that you thought, “We got to move on this?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","00:56"
"Donald Trump","Well, I think when I started seeing and reading about China, and seeing what was going on in China, Wuhan specifically, it seemed to come mostly out of there, that area, the province. And when I saw that and I saw the death they were talking about on television, in the papers, and I started reading a lot about it. And really when I had to make a decision, do I stop people from China and specifically that area, but from China, to come into the country and everybody was against it, almost everybody I would say was just absolutely against it. We’ve never done it before. We never made a decision like that-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","01:03"
"Bill Hemmer","Did somebody come to you with a bit of information, a piece of data? Was it a world leader? Was it a member of your own team?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","01:40"
"Donald Trump","No, there was instinct to know. We had a large group of people right behind me in the Oval Office and I made… I consulted with Mike, but we made a decision, I made a decision to close off to China. That was weeks early and honestly, I took a lot of heat. Sleepy Joe Biden said, “It’s xenophobic.” I don’t know if he knows what that means, but that’s okay. He said, “It’s racist,” what I did. Thousands and thousands of more people, probably tens of thousands, would be dead right now if I didn’t make that decision, and I must say doctors, nobody wanted to make that decision at the time. It was very, very early. Call it luck or call talent, it doesn’t matter, we made a great decision. I took a lot of heat from China, they weren’t happy with it. Now they understand it. They’ve really… We’re doing just fine, but they were not happy with it. I took a lot of heat from a lot of people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","01:47"
"Bill Hemmer","Bring the conversation to present day, in the past day and a half you got a lot of tension for this, a tweet that I think went out late at night, you said, “We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","02:46"

"Bill Hemmer","So you start to look at this 15 day which will come to us day 15 is next Monday, today arguably day nine, what are you trying to gauge as to how you can open the country back up again?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","02:56"
"Donald Trump","Yeah, when you say, I took a lot of heat for that, essentially. I really didn’t, I mean, a lot of people agree with me. Our country’s not supposed to be… It’s not built to shut down. Our people are full of vim and vigor and energy, they don’t want to be locked into a house or an apartment or some space, it’s not for our country, we’re not built that way. And I said, “I don’t want the cure to be worse than the problem itself,” the problem being obviously the problem. You can destroy a country this way by closing it down where it literally goes from being the most prosperous, I mean, we had the best economy in the history of our country three weeks ago and then all of a sudden was supposed to shut it down, and then we’re supposed to pay people not to go to work. We never had that. We used to pay people to go to work when we had a problem.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","03:10"
"Bill Hemmer","But this is a government order to go ahead and stay home.

"Bill Hemmer","Utah. Louisiana could be different from Arizona. So how do you go about making that decision?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","04:09"
"Donald Trump","Well, you have to make the decision. Look, we lose thousands, I brought some numbers here, we lose thousands and thousands of people a year to the flu. We don’t turn the country off, I mean every year. Now when I heard the number, we average 37,000 people a year. Can you believe that? And actually this year we’re having a bad flu season, but we lose thousands of people a year to the flu. We never turn the country off. We lose much more than that to automobile accidents. We didn’t call up the automobile companies, say, “Stop making cars. We don’t want any cars anymore.” We have to get back to work. Now, with all of that being said, it’s incredible what the American people have done and honestly the American people have learned, we’ve all learned together between the shaking of the hands of the washing of the hands. Well, I used to wash my hands and I always wash my hands a lot, I never was a big believer in shaking hands, once I become a politician, you shake hands and you get a little bit used to it. Immediately when I see you, I apologize that I’m not shaking your hand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","04:15"

"Donald Trump","I canceled the deal last night. I said, “I’m not going to sign that deal,” because Nancy Pelosi came in and put a lot of things in the deal that had nothing to do with the workers, that had to do with an agenda that they’ve been trying to get passed for 10 years. And I came in, I told Mike, I told a lot of people, “There’s no way I’m signing that deal.” I was getting calls from John Kennedy, from Ben Sasse, from many, many people, Lindsay, I was getting calls from a lot of different people saying this deal, Tom Cotton, this deal is terrible what they’ve done. They took a deal, we almost had a deal the day before and it was between Schumer and Mitch and it was really a good solid deal. All of a sudden they start throwing all of the little Green New Deal stuff in, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","05:59"
"Donald Trump","And the boardrooms, what they look like, and we want green energy, we want all this stuff, let’s stop drilling oil. They had things in there that were terrible, windmills all over the place and all sorts of credits for windmills. They kill the birds and ruin the real estate, right? A lot of problems. I mean a lot of problems.

"Donald Trump","But we have great things for not only companies, forget the companies, the companies are nothing other than they are an employer of thousands and thousands of people and they pay them very well, we want to protect our workers.

"Harris Faulkner","Hello, Mr. President, so good to see you today. This’ll be a little bit to relay. I understand you guys are going back and forth on the economy and employers, but more than 66% of people are employed by small businesses. The VP talked a little bit about this, we hear you dropping big companies names. The question here is how do you shore up both as you look forward?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","08:21"
"Bill Hemmer","Yeah. The question’s a good one and it’s pointed, you’re talking about Boeing and yet you’ve got, what two thirds of American businesses are small businesses, and you think about what they’re trying to do in terms of adjusting to this new reality that’s been thrown on them. What will you do for small business?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","08:46"
"Donald Trump","Okay, well first of all I have to say that Harris is one of my favorite people and I didn’t hear a word she said and I was hoping it wasn’t too devastating a question, but she is a fantastic person. I have to say that. Okay, now that I’ve said it because I can’t hear Harris, but no, the bill is very much focused on the small business person. It’s very much focused on small companies including restaurants and all sorts of small companies, and what people don’t realize, you’re talking about these massive, we have the greatest companies in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","09:03"
"Donald Trump","You add them all up and the small businesses are just about equal in size to these massive companies of which we have many, also. It’s the engine of our country, small business. This bill is absolutely aimed at the small business and the worker, and the workers of those small businesses and the owners, the owners are going to need help. They’re going to need some loans, they’re going to need things and we’re going to be able to take care of them because we don’t want those small businesses to go out of business, nor do we want the big businesses to go out of business.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","09:33"

It’s coming in.” And I knew that and I made the early decision with China. So I already closed it off to China and that was a long time before they came in. But they came in, experts, and they said, “We’re going to have to close the country.” I said, “We’ve never closed the country before. This has never happened before.” I said, “Are you serious about this? We are going to take this country that’s fully employed. Well we have 160 million people working and you’re telling me we have to close it and people are going to go out of business and they’re going to go bankrupt and they’re not going to have jobs.

"Donald Trump","Look, I accept things, I understand things very quickly. I mean, I understood exactly what they were saying, but we can socially distance ourselves and go to work and you’ll have to work a little bit harder. You can clean your hands five times more than you used to. You don’t have to shake hands anymore with people, that might be something good coming out of this.

"Donald Trump","They loved me and I loved them, but it is a little bit colder. But you won’t be shaking hands for at least a while and things will happen. But we have to put the country to work. Look, you’re going to lose a number of people to the flu, but you’re going to lose more people by putting a country into a massive recession or depression, you’re going to lose people. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands, you’re going to have all sorts of things happen. You’re going to have instability. You can’t just come in and say, let’s close up the United States of America, the biggest, the most successful country in the world by far. When I came in, when I was elected, and you knew this number, China was going to overtake us in the year 2019, wasn’t even close. We went way up and they didn’t. We’ve done great. They pay us a fortune and tariffs and everything else, and yet we have a good relationship with them. We just signed a trade deal. But we’re the number one in the world by far.

"Donald Trump","One of the most difficult decisions I’ve ever made because I knew that when you do it, as soon as you do it, you’re going to drop. I mean, they’re talking about 20 or 25 points of GDP. Nobody’s ever heard of 25 points. If we went down a point, that’s a big deal. Now all of a sudden you’re basically turning off the country. I said, this has never been done before. What are you talking about? But we understand it, you have hotspots, but we’ve had hotspots before, we’ve had horrible flus. I mean, think of it, we average 36,000 people death, death. I’m not talking about cases. I’m talking about death. 36,000 deaths a year. People die, 36, from the flu, but we’ve never closed down the country for the flu. So you say to yourself, what is this all about. Now, it’s never been done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","13:08"

"Donald Trump","Not good. I wasn’t happy about it and I also knew that I had to do it. Look, with Turkey, I give this as an example, and Syria, I said, sign a deal with the Kurds, make peace. Erdogan, he didn’t want to. He’s a man who loves Turkey and I have a very good relation. I said, sign a deal. He didn’t really want to, the Kurds didn’t really want to, and it went on, the so-called safe zone, recently, few months ago. I said, sign a deal, do me a favor, sign the deal, get it done. They didn’t really want to. All of a sudden they start fighting, fighting, fighting, fighting, and it was vicious and other countries got involved. Now I say, let’s sign a deal. They said, okay, we’ll sign a deal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","14:05"

"Donald Trump","Bill, somehow the word got out that this is the thing we’re supposed to be doing. Now we’ve had some really bad epidemics and other things. I mean this pandemic, but we’ve had bad epidemics. I’m sure they could have been called pandemics. But we never did a thing like this before, but I had to do it. It’s been very painful for our country and very destabilizing for our country and we have to go back to work much sooner than people thought.

"Bill Hemmer","One last question then we’ll get back to our viewers here too. A month ago, the CDC had our initial test that failed. At that moment, late February, you said, it’s perfect, and it wasn’t perfect. So what happened there in the early stages in late February?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","15:38"
"Donald Trump","What I said is perfect, was my conversation with the head of the Ukraine. That’s what I really said is perfect. Okay, that was another whole scandal, nonsense, a total witch hunt. But this one is a much different thing. We had other administrations, not just the last one, they built up a platform. They built up a test, but the test was no good. It didn’t handle large numbers of people. It was okay for a very small group but not for a large group. So we had to break it down-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","15:53"

"Donald Trump","I don’t think CDC screwed up either. They had a test that would have worked for a small group of people. In other words, for a normal problem. I don’t think anybody could have, in all fairness to CDC, and this is a big government agency and they’re very good people in there, but nobody ever expected a thing like this. Nobody would say that millions and millions of people would have been tested. So what we did is we broke that egg, we broke that system, and we’ve created a new system that now we’re doing unbelievably big numbers and it’s set for the future should we ever need it again. I hope we don’t need it again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","16:28"
"Bill Hemmer","Thank you for your time. We’re going to bring the others in as well in a moment. Thank you for being patient. We will get to you. We have so many questions, not only from our network but from millions of people all across the country. So your questions in a moment here as we continue live in the Rose Garden at the White House with the President and his task force in Washington.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","17:04"
"Harris Faulkner","Welcome back to our Fox News virtual town hall with President Trump and his coronavirus task force. Excited to finally get to be able to talk one on one with him now, we’ve got our tech problems worked out. I want to first ask you, Mr. President about the idea of the political division that’s going on on Capitol Hill. You’re talking about these bills, this phase one, two and three of the stimulus bill, like they’re going to fix so much with the economy and people are literally fighting like cats. I mean, what can you do to bring them together?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","17:28"
"Donald Trump","Well, I think they’re actually coming together. We had a bill that was done the other night and then all of a sudden somebody else injected herself in and all … we didn’t have anything that was even remotely signable. But now I hear just from a few minutes ago that they’re doing well and it’s for the workers, it’s for the people of the country and I hear they’re doing pretty well, so we’ll see how it comes out. I watched Governor Cuomo and he was very nice. We’re building him hospitals. We’re building him medical centers and he was complaining about … we’re doing probably more, definitely more than anybody else. And he was talking about the ventilators, but he should have ordered the ventilators and he had a choice, he had a chance because right here, I just got this out that he refused to order 15,000 ventilators. I’ll show this to Bill, but take a look at that, Bill. What does that say?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","17:58"

"Donald Trump","This says that New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic, for a pandemic, established death panels and lotteries instead. So he had a chance to buy in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down. I’m not blaming him or anything else, but he shouldn’t be talking about us. He’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators. We’re going to help. But if you think about, Governor Cuomo, we’re building him four hospitals, we’re building him four medical centers, we’re working very, very hard for the people of New York. We’re working along with him and then I watch him on the show complaining. And he had 16,000 ventilators that he could have had at a great price that he didn’t buy them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","18:54"
"Harris Faulkner","Yeah, and I hear you going back and forth and, and Governor Cuomo has talked in recent days that you regularly talk and have a good relationship. And so we will follow the news as you’re bringing it to us there, right there in the Rose Garden. I want to get to a viewer because the people’s voice is so huge right now and always Mr. President. Joyce submitted a question from Facebook about the stimulus checks. Let’s watch, and I want to get your reaction.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","19:40"
"Joyce","I am fortunate I can continue to work. I can telecommute. There are people who are losing jobs, they’re losing an entire income for a household and rather than receive a check, I would just like to pay it forward and have the government pass mine on to someone else.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","20:04"
"Donald Trump","Wow, is that great? Well, you obviously come from West Virginia. I love that state and thank you very much, Joyce. I’ll tell you what, that’s great. I wish we had more people like Joyce, I’ll tell you. But it’s going to be a substantial amount of money, around $3,000 for a family of four. And assuming it all gets done, assuming we can get the Democrats to sign it, but it’ll be great. But Joyce, I think that’s such a nice gesture, really I appreciate it, thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","20:24"
"Harris Faulkner","Well, and you just said, right, when you and I began talking a few minutes ago that almost in breaking news fashion, it looks like the juggernaut might be moving on Capitol Hill to try to push toward that stimulus bill. So we’ll be watching for that. You know Mr. President, I’m watching the Dow as you have been talking and formerly the Vice President, it’s up by more than 1,500 points. What do you watch for each day? I mean, are you keeping your eye on that? Is it companies calling you, small and large? What is your barometer that, okay, things were in trouble or things are doing better?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","20:52"
"Donald Trump","Well, I think the Dow was helped by the fact that there were theories that we’re going to stay out for four or five months and you can’t do that as a … you destroy our country if you did a thing like that. And we’re going to be opening relatively soon. Our time comes up, Monday or Tuesday are the allotted two weeks, but we’ll stay a little bit longer than that. But we want to get open very soon. I think that was a big reason it’s gone up. I also think that the fact that the Senate and the House, we seem to be getting along as much as you can get along. We seem to be getting along now on a bill. I think that may be had even less of an impact and the fact that we’re opening up this incredible country because we have to do that. I’d love to have it open by Easter, okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","21:29"

"Donald Trump","I would love to have it open by Easter. I will tell you that right now. I would love to have that.

"Allison","My question is this, if you were to get the coronavirus, can it mutate? And can you get it again?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","22:59"

"Deborah Birx","So that’s a great question and a very smart question because it’s an RNA virus, it can mutate and it constantly mutates. But what has been pretty good about the coronaviruses in general is they keep their structural pieces very similar. What do I mean by that? There’s certain, the outer coat, the envelope and the inside part of the virus has stayed very constant. It’s even very similar to SARS, which we haven’t seen since 2003. And so what has been picked for sites, both for the vaccine and for monoclonal antibodies, are very much those constant sites. And we believe that anybody who becomes positive and makes effective antibody, because there are some people who can’t make as good of antibody as others, but if you make effective antibody, you shouldn’t get reinfected.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","23:08"
"Bill Hemmer","The way it was described to me and correct the medical positioning of this question, but the virus is trying to figure out a way to survive and that’s where it moves around and it mutates. Now in Singapore, there was a headline earlier today suggesting a possible second wave in that island nation. How do you gauge that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","23:54"
"Deborah Birx","Well, remember in Singapore, they took the president’s guidelines and they executed them very early because they could see China next door. And so they saw those and they implemented those guidelines. So very few people became infected in Singapore. Because so few people have been infected, you don’t have what they call herd immunity. And so until we get through this current pandemic, if it has seasonality, which we hope and believe it could, if it gets through this current season, it will be in everybody’s best interest to do as the President has recommended, our work on vaccines, our work on additional therapeutics and really getting to both pre and post prophylaxis. So that the healthcare providers can get a shot potentially that will protect them, we would call it pre-exposure prophylaxis. All of those things are being worked on to prepare us for the next season. So we’re focused today on what we need today and to get through this current epidemic, and then we’re also getting prepared in case it comes back in the fall or in case it comes back in the fall of 2021 when we’d have a vaccine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","24:15"
"Bill Hemmer","I’m going to bring in the surgeon general in this and to both of you, I’ve been listening to you very carefully for weeks now and what you’ve said is, we want to be the model of South Korea. Well, South Korea has flattened the curve to borrow a phrase and their death rate is about one point two percent. This morning here in the U.S., our death rate was right around that same mark, one point three percent. To the surgeon general, what does that tell you or how much do you consider the death rate here at home when we try and make decisions for ourselves?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","25:24"

The first one is that when you look at the data here in the United States, of all-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","25:54"
"Jerome Adams","Is that when you look at the data here in the United States, of all the people who we’ve tested so far, only about 90% of those, well 90% of those folks do not have the coronavirus, they test negative. So most people, even when they have cold and flu symptoms, do not have coronavirus, number one. Number two, 98%, 99% of people are recovering. So people need to understand that yes, some people will get coronavirus in many communities across America, but that most of them will recover, that’s very important for people to understand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","26:03"
"Jerome Adams","And beyond that, we’re trying to help people understand the importance of stopping the spread. And the president, when he, nine days ago, listened to his health providers, his health consultants, he said, “What do we need to do right now?” And we said, “We need to lean into this next two weeks to stop the spread, and then we need to reassess.” And one thing I can tell you for certain is that I’ve been on the task force for three weeks and the president listens to Tony Falchi, he listens to Dr. Birx, he listens when I, or Dr. Carson, or Dr. Hahn, or Dr. Redfield, speak up, and he also listens to the governors. And so, we will assess at the end of the 14 days and we’ll figure out the most appropriate thing to do, and based on my experience in the task force so far, the president will make an appropriate decision based on all the data.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","26:36"

They’re the ones working every moment with the patients to ensure that they do well. They’re the ones at the bedside, they’re the ones providing comfort, they’re the ones providing the medical interventions, and they are our first priority. It is why we’ve worked so hard to get the protective, personal protective equipment out there. But I think, what we didn’t often talk about is we’re really, with the changing guidelines for testing, that is going to free up all of that personal protective devices that were being utilized for testing back into the hospitals and the clinics for our nurses and doctors, and that’s going to make millions of more mask and PPE, as we call it, available to the hospital workers who need it the most, because now people can self test.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","28:54"
"Jerome Adams","And Bill, can I jump in on that really quickly? I want people to know that, I’m a still practicing anesthesiologist at Walter Reed, the vice president and I, we first met during Ebola, and I went into the hospital, I put on PPE, I know how scary it is even when you have the proper equipment to deal with an infectious disease. And I’m getting texts, phone calls, messages from people all across the country, and I want healthcare workers of America to know, we are fighting for you each and every day to make sure you get what you need from the stockpile, to make sure you get what you need from manufacturers across America, to make sure you’re getting decreased demand, which is why we put out our new guidelines on elective surgeries.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","29:52"
"Jerome Adams","And because it’s not just about increasing the supply, we aren’t going to supply our way out of this problem, as important as supply is, we need to also lower demand by decreasing unnecessary usage of PPE. And a game changer that just came out just this week, was the new FDA self swabs, and the vice president and the president have talked about that, that we’ll utilize less PPE. So we’re working on making sure supply gets where it needs to, and FEMA’s doing a great job of that, of lowering demand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","30:35"

"Jerome Adams","Well, right now the FDA is making that more available. We’ve seen testing increase, and real numbers, when you look at last week from Monday to Friday, the amount of testing increased 10 fold, so we’re seeing testing increase. The concern is that it’s actually using up more PPE, which is why we want to prioritize testing for the people who are most in need, the healthcare workers and the people who are vulnerable, and why we’re pushing. The FDA has lowered barriers like none other to make sure we can get these new testing modalities available that use less PPE and do more tests.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","31:04"

"Harris Faulkner","All right. Actually, you know what? I want to stay on this a home testing kit topic for just a second with Dr. Birx. The home test, is there a place where people check a box and say I’m positive or not? How are you going to keep up with people who test themselves, and you need that information Dr. Birx, to know where the clusters are in the country, that’s part of why you would do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","31:38"
"Deborah Birx","Great. So it’s not a home test, it’s a self test. So what do I mean by that? I mean the individual can drive up, receive the items, because again we still want to just test people with fever and symptoms that really need to be tested. They can self swab the front of their nose, put it in the container, then the person can collect it with gloves, gloves alone with the biohazard bag, and get it in. I just want to speak to the Americans for just a second though, we have to ensure that we still are testing, even though probably by today we will have done more tests than South Korea did an eight weeks, in the last eight days. In the last eight days we’ve done more testing than South Korea. But, we did that because we transformed the testing process as the president spoke to, but we don’t want people who are just worried to go get tested.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","32:01"
"Deborah Birx","If you don’t have a persistent fever, if you don’t have a cough, if you’re not in the risk group, if you’re not a nurse or doctor, we really want the testing and the drive through testing and the testing that is provided in the cities, to be very much still focused on the people who need it. Because there’s only so much even those high throughput machines are doing, they’re doing about 50,000, 60,000, 70,000 tests a day now. They could get potentially to 150,000 a day, but we want to make sure we’re testing in the areas that really have the problems.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","32:51"

"Mike Pence","Yeah, thanks Harris. The American people are asking all the time, the president and I hear it all the time and see it, it’s what can they do to make a difference? And an in addition to the 15 days to slow the spread, the American people can take Dr. Birx’s advice. It’s that old proverb, that it’s not the healthy who need a doctor but the sick, and one of the ways that you can help is by recognizing we want to focus testing on people that have symptoms. Although according to the tests now as the surgeon general said, 90% of the people that have been tested for the coronavirus don’t have it, okay? That number, we’ve tested more than 320,000 people, and that’s an encouraging number I would expect. But for any American out there that just may be concerned, but not be symptomatic, one of the ways you can make sure the testing is available for people that have symptoms, and just as importantly for our healthcare workers that we want to make sure have all the protective equipment that they need, you can recognize that if you don’t have symptoms, don’t do a test.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","33:29"

"Donald Trump","Harris, one thing I might add, that to me is so important, again, we took something that was broken and we made it the model. And I didn’t even know, I just heard the number for the first time from Deborah, that in a short period of time, we’ve more testing than South Korea. Now you’re not going to read that in the newspapers because they don’t like to write things like that, but I’d love you to say that one more time because that’s a big number.

Those rates are coming in, in the 28% range.

"Deborah Birx","I think part of it is density, part of is the spread that may have happened on metal surfaces like in the subway and people that were in the subway, part of it may be a large number of people came back after Christmas from Asia that didn’t get caught up in the closure.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","36:14"

What we’re trying to do now is use 21st century solutions and trying to get data down to the most granular level so we understand what’s happening at the area of the spread.

I think we’re substantially under 1% because the people that get better are not reporting.

Usually we’ll have 50 governors of the call at the same time. No, I think we’re doing very well, but you know, it’s a two-way street. They have to treat us well also. They can’t say, “Oh gee, we should get this. We should get that.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","42:42"
"Donald Trump","We’re doing a great job like in New York where we’re building, as I said, four hospitals, four medical … We’re literally building hospitals and medical centers and then I hear that there’s a problem with ventilators. Well we sent them ventilators and they could have had 15 or 16000. All they had to do is order them two years ago, but they decided not to do it. They can’t blame us for that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","43:13"

"Mehmet Oz","President Trump, a good surgeon knows after the surgery when his patient can be discharged and these 15 days are like a big operation on America, but a great surgeon knows when there’s a complication after discharge. So if we can meet the goal of fixing America and getting it back on his feet by Easter, I’d love to know exactly how you know that it’s safe from medical perspective. What’s going to indicate that we might have to pull back a tiny bit in case we have a relapse?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","43:39"
"Donald Trump","Well I think doctor a thing like that could happen, but I really believe that we could do much of what we’re doing and we could do it from a work environment instead of an environment where everybody’s locked up and everybody is saying, “Oh, the business is gone, the business is gone,” and everybody’s suffering depression. You know better than anybody about depression. I’ve watched where you talk about depression and that causes death and it causes a lot of problems and these are people they want to save their business. They don’t want to be locked up in some room or some apartment or house, and in the meantime, their restaurants close, their businesses close. They want to be saving their business.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","44:05"
"Donald Trump","And I believe very strongly you’re going to lose far more people by going that way than you are if we kept this thing going. I could keep them out. I’m sure that we have doctors that would say, “Let’s keep it closed for two years, okay? Let’s close it up for two years.” No. We got to get it open. Our people want it open and that’s the way this country was built.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","44:43"
"Bill Hemmer","Dr. Nicole Saphier now. Doctor, go ahead with your question.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","45:04"
"Nicole Saphier","Thank you. And president Trump, I do believe as a nation that we are beholden to you for your decisive swift action in the beginning with the travel ban. I do think that we would have been in a much different, worse situation had that not happened. However, we still did have a lag in the testing, which of course did not have anything to do with you, but my question is for Dr. Birx and the task force. As we still see across the nation that some people are not able to get tests. I have colleagues that still can’t test some of their patients. Is there a plan to fast track or even parallel track rapid [inaudible 00:45:38] serological testing to try and get this out there so that we can mobilize more PPE and more hospital beds by doing more testing and being able to isolate those people quickly?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","45:09"
"Deborah Birx","Yeah, that’s a very good question. So right now, the tests that we have are all based on the RNA of the virus. And so we’re utilizing the platforms, and thank goodness we’re utilizing the platforms that were developed really to work and support HIV positive clients. So this is their machines that have been used to detect their viral load for the last more than a decade in the United States. Those machines right now are being utilized for this test in a high throughput way. We’ve asked developers to work on a point of care fingerprint test that could be used for antibody and antigen, but the antibody tests will only tell you if you have been infected. Even if we can get IGM, it will be part of the early and probably recovery phase. And then we’re working with companies to work on getting RNA tests at our point of care.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","45:50"
"Deborah Birx","So these are really critical tests that people are working on right now. But in the meantime, we’re using what we have today to ensure that we can get more testing done. And I just want to say, I want to thank the American people and physicians who have let us prioritize. Remember, we didn’t have this platform until eight days ago. We’ve done all of these diagnoses for inpatients primarily so that they can get on the appropriate therapy and we prioritize our testing to hospital patients. We will, over the next few weeks, be able to make more tests available to the actual American public with symptoms and to doctor’s offices as you’ve requested.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","46:39"
"Donald Trump","And Nicole, it’s important to remember we’ve done more tests in eight days than South Korea has done in eight weeks. And our tests are better, they’re highly sophisticated and frankly I took one. It’s not the most pleasant thing in the world, I will tell you that. We’re going to have a much simpler test very soon, but we have a really good test and we’ve done more in eight days. Nobody knows that. I just heard this number a few minutes ago. I learned it from being on your show actually. Pretty impressive.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","47:16"

"Mike Pence","It’s personal hygiene, it’s if you’re sick, stay home. If someone in your house has the virus stay home, but it’s also avoiding groups of more than 10, avoiding unnecessary travel, don’t eat in restaurants during this period of time. Use the drive-through. These are all the principles that every American can do. Now there are going to be Americans that have different guidance from their state and local officials that are more stringent. We defer to that, we respect that, but the more Americans that do this, the sooner that we’ll be able, as the president said, to get back to work.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-coronavirus-town-hall-transcript-march-24-trump-wants-to-restart-the-economy-by-easter","Donald Trump Coronavirus Town Hall Transcript March 24: Trump Wants to Restart the Economy by Easter","48:57"
