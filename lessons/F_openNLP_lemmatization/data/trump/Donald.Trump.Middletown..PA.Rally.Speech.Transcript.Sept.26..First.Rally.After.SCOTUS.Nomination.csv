"Donald Trump","Well, we won Pennsylvania last time and we’re going to win it by a lot more this time I can see. Because four years ago we had a lot of enthusiasm, but we have more now. Even the fake news will admit that. They [crosstalk 00:00:23].

"Donald Trump","Hello Pennsylvania. Thank you very much for being here in the rain. As we stand together in the rain, it’s supposed to bring luck and we’ll take it. Ah, my man. I just came from the Rose Garden of the White House. Thank you very much, and I love you too. I do. Thank you. Or I wouldn’t have done this. I wouldn’t have done it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","00:27"
"Donald Trump","But we’re doing well. Our country’s going to be stronger than ever before very soon. You watch. It’s happening. It’s all happening beautifully. It’s happening. We had to close it down. We saved millions of lives. We opened it up and we’re doing record kind of numbers, and we’re going to have the best year and we’re going to have a great third quarter, so thank you very much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","01:12"
"Donald Trump","I’ve just come from the Rose Garden of the White House, where I proudly nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the United States Supreme Court. Judge Barrett is a brilliant legal mind, an extraordinary scholar. You know that. Number one in her class. You know the professor, one of the most respected people, he said the greatest student he’s ever had. That’s pretty good. That’s a little better than Biden, wouldn’t you say? She should be running for president instead of …","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","01:39"
"Donald Trump","Now it’s a little bit better, academically, slightly better. Most important of all, she will defend your God-given rights and freedoms. She will. Judge Barrett would become the third Supreme Court justice along with over 300 … think of this. This is our third domination. We have Justice Gorsuch, Justice Kavanaugh, and now we have Amy, along with over 300 federal judges by the end of this term. We’ve confirmed to uphold our laws and constitution as written, and that’s a record.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","02:15"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden has refused to provide his list because the names will be handpicked by socialists like Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC plus three and Ilhan Omar. That’s a great one. She’s a great one. Always complaining. She’s always complaining. Came here, things worked out for her. How did she come here? Does anybody know how she came here? AOC plus three. That’s a beauty. That’s a group of real … They love our country so much.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","02:54"
"Donald Trump","They’ve given power. The far left will pack the Supreme Court with radicals who will terminate the second amendment. That’s what they want to do, strike the words under God from your Pledge of Allegiance, tear down crosses from public spaces and force taxpayers to fund extreme late-term abortion. That’s what they’re looking to do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","03:32"
"Donald Trump","These left-wing justices will cripple police departments, protect sanctuary cities and declare the death penalty unconstitutional for even the most depraved mass murders. It’s unconstitutional. We will save your second amendment and together we will save our country, and that’s what we’re doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","03:56"

"Donald Trump","That’s a lot of people. We have tens of thousands of people. If sleepy Joe came here, I really mean this, you know the little circles he fills and he can’t get them full? You have like five of them, those circles, those big beautiful … Whoever does it does a nice job. They’re very round. But he’s got five of them and then he stands very far back and walks in.

"Donald Trump","We have tens of thousands. Somebody said 17, 18,000. Last night we had 35,000 people. You saw that in Virginia. We’re making a play for Virginia because we have a governor in Virginia, you know that, he wants to totally end … All he does is talk about terminating the second amendment. That’s all he talks about. That’s all he talks about. In 38 days, we will win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. We will win four more years in the White House. Right?

"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Great honor. It’s a great honor. We’ve achieved a lot together. It’s together is what happened. Wait’ll you see the numbers on November 3rd. Get out and vote. Go early vote. Do whatever you have to do.

"Donald Trump","Did you see today? There was a big mishap with the ballots. Another one. This is every day they have that, Mike. Every day, big mishap with the ballots. One of them, New York has said, “Well, we’re going to change the system a little bit.” It’s a little late for doing that, isn’t it? New York wants to change their system. They’re going to work on something. Governor Cuomo, he’s going to work on something now. Well, the ballots are flowing.

"Donald Trump","Then in a certain location, you know the location, they mailed a thousand ballots out. Unfortunately they doubled it up and everybody in this Democrat area got two ballots instead of one. Then two days ago they found eight ballots in a wastepaper basket. Unfortunately, they all had the name Trump written on them. We were going to vote for Trump. They were military ballots, the military.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","06:45"
"Donald Trump","Then they have a stream in a very good state and they found lots of ballots dumped in this stream. Look, look, this is not right. What they’re doing is not right. It’s all run by these ballots, the ones we’re talking about, whether it’s Pennsylvania, because we’re going to win in Pennsylvania. You got to watch, but you have a governor who’s in charge of ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","07:12"
"Donald Trump","North Carolina, Michigan, Nevada, all of these places, they’re all run by Democrats. They’re the ones that count the ballots. Does anybody have even a doubt? It’s just common sense. It’s common sense. We’re going to be very careful. We’re going to watch. You know we’re waiting for rulings from a great federal judge in your state, federal judge, about the constitutionality of the whole thing. They’re going to try and steal the election. Look at this crap. The only way they can win Pennsylvania, frankly, is to cheat on the ballots. That’s the way I look at it. That’s the way I look at it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","07:35"
"Donald Trump","They just had a big thing today. They said there was a mistake made on a lot of the ballots. They’re going to try and redo the system. Take a look at Iowa during the primary. Remember the first primary? They couldn’t do anything. It was all a mess. It was all a mess. Good job. Good job. Look at this guy. Good job. Good job.

He just opened his mouth and we had that gentleman in the beautiful blue … Will you stand up? Stand up. Man. Are you in law enforcement because you were on him. This guy hadn’t gotten the first word out. That’s the kind of guy I want working for me right there. Man, great. That was just instinct. That’s called natural instinct.

"Donald Trump","Under my administration, we proudly achieved energy independence. We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. Sleepy Joe Biden has vowed to ban fracking. That’s not good for Pennsylvania.

"Donald Trump","He went to a place called Texas, no oil, no God and no guns in Texas. That doesn’t work. But you know what? Doesn’t work here either. You’re a big fracker. It’s a big business here, 900,000 jobs, but he wants to eradicate all of the things that you’re doing, all of the things that are bringing in so much money for your state. It’s a disgrace.

"Donald Trump","All right. I used to say, “Now, now, now, we won, we won. Now, don’t do it.” But didn’t say [inaudible 00:11:11], but I try and stop it. But now I, she’s crazy. Bill is stone cold afraid of her. No, but how about remember the emails? You think we forgot? We didn’t forget the emails. You remember the emails when Congress said, “We want 33,000 emails,” and they deleted the emails? They deleted everything, the text messages, everything, they deleted. If Mike Kelly did that he’d be out of a job so fast. He’d be gone, right? He’d be gone. None of us, we wouldn’t last long.

"Donald Trump","I’ll tell you what, we got to get back to Congress and go after these people. These people are sick. They’re sick. It was a whole big con job with shifty Schiff and the whole group. Shifty Schiff, he gets up and says a totally different thing than what I said, totally different. They say, “Sir, you can’t go after him because he’s shielded because he made this speech.” He totally lied.

What a jerk. We got to deal with people like that. I’ll tell ya. I’ll tell ya. How do you come together with people like that, they’re totally dishonest, because I want the country to come together. We were coming together until we got hit with a plague from China. We were coming together. I was getting calls from stone, cold, radical left, hard line Democrats, let’s start talking.

I always sort of smile when he said, like [inaudible 00:15:18], “We should have done this. We should have done that. We should have,” all these things. I said, “Why didn’t you do them?” He’s been there for … It’s not like he left 20 years ago, 47 years and he left three and a half years ago. Why the hell didn’t you do them?

All these text messages, and from what I hear, they have some real beauties coming out over the next couple of days, so [crosstalk 00:17:27]. When somebody said, “Oh, you can’t do that.

And then I jokingly said, one time, “Everybody gets a beautiful brand new Rolls Royce.” And CNN said, “He lied. He said that all illegal immigrants got a $750,000 car.” It’s true. They said he lied. I didn’t. I was only kidding. They said I lied over the Rolls Royce. You remember when I said, “Russia, if you’re listening, find her emails.” Or whatever the hell I said. “Find her emails.” And then we all laughed together. 25,000 people in the stadium on television. Look at all the cameras on television. Look at those people. Look at all those red lights that are going on. They’re standing in the rain just like I am, but they don’t like it. But do you remember?

He asked Russia to please get her emails.” Or whatever the hell we were asking for “Russia, if you’re listening, please get…” The whole place cracks up along with me.

"Donald Trump","Thank you. Thank you very much. We’re in the rain together. That’s all right. We’ll stay out here all night if we have to, right? But I’ll tell you, so many interesting things are going on. When I look at their plans… Did you see their plans? The manifesto? That’s the Bernie Sanders and AOC manifesto. Normally when you negotiate with communists, because I don’t think it’s… Haven’t they gone over the… I don’t think it’s… This is no longer socialism. We’re dealing with worst than socialism. This is communism. But when you deal with socialist communists, you’re supposed to bring them a little bit to the right, right? You’re a Democrat, you bring… They started with a plan and they went further left. This plan is the most horrible. We call it the manifesto. Bernie Sanders. Crazy Bernie. But you know the one thing they agree with us? On trade. Because we are being ripped off by so many countries. I’ve stopped a lot of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","22:33"
"Donald Trump","I mean, I had to devote a lot of time to a fake impeachment. Now you see how fake the impeachment was. What about Biden’s son getting three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow? And then they say, “Donald Trump is dealing with Russia. Donald Trump.” I never even made a call. “Donald Trump is dealing.” This guy got three and a half million dollars from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. What the hell was that for?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","23:33"
"Donald Trump","Probably his great experience in energy, but he didn’t have that. And then it revealed yesterday that he got a lot more money from China than we thought and he got a lot more money, right? It’s just all stuff. It’s like perfect. It’s like unbelievable. But he got a lot more money from China and the 100, the 83 or 63,000 a month that he was getting, now it looks like it was 183,000 a month. And he got an upfront payment of $3 million from Ukraine. This is because of his great knowledge of energy, but he had none. They said, “Do you know anything about energy?” “No, I don’t happen to know anything.” Oh. And then the father called for the prosecutor, “Get him out or you’re not getting your billion dollars from the United States.” Whoa. They got him out and here’s your billion. That’s not a quid pro quo. Right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","24:07"
"Donald Trump","But a perfect phone call is a quid pro quo where nothing was… It’s a disgrace. Well, hopefully we’re getting to the bottom of all that stuff because we got plenty. Biden’s plan for mass amnesty would bankrupt your social security system. You remember me when I got elected, they all said, “Oh, he’s going to hurt…” They love to say that’s going to hurt because they give dis-information. They say a lie like the soldiers and the graves and they put it in. Can you imagine? No animal that I know would say that. Nobody. They make up a lie and then they go with it. Social security. They said four years ago. Now they said again. By the way, your social security, we never touched it. Not even touched it. They said he will destroy your social security. No. They will destroy it because they’ll destroy your country and your social security will be worthless. That’s what’s going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","25:01"
"Donald Trump","In just three and a half years, we’ve secured America’s borders, rebuilt the awesome power of the US military, obliterated 100% of the ISIS [inaudible 00:07:07]. Fixed our disastrous trade deals and brought jobs back home to America and back home to the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under 16 years of presidents, Obama and Bush, household income rose only $2,945. These are right out of the book. So 16 years, less than 3,000. In three years with us, it rose 6,483. So much less than half [inaudible 00:07:42]. And if you include energy savings, how do you like paying those $2 for a gasoline and even less [inaudible 00:26:51]?

"Donald Trump","We’re number one in the world. How do you like that? If you include that, it’s $10,000. That’s over three years, three and a half years. We lifted 6.6 million people out of poverty, which is a wreck. We built the greatest economy in the history of the world. Now we are very, very rapidly… You see the numbers. It’s happening all over again. We’ve added a historic 10.6 million jobs in the last four months. There’s never been a record like that. We’ve added more jobs than any time, four months, not even close. To fight the China virus, we launched the largest national mobilization since World War II.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","26:54"
"Donald Trump","They said, “How did you do it?” I say we get an A plus, but I get a D in public relations because we were so busy working. When you give it to the fake news, they report it incorrectly. So I figured what’s the use of even dealing with it? We did a job, including ventilators that nobody had. We took over. The cupboards were bare when we took over. We pioneered life saving therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85% since April. Whoever heard of that? And Europe, which is having a big surge right now, they used to use Europe, “Oh, look how Europe is doing.” We’re doing well. We don’t want them to have a surge. Europe has had almost a 50% greater excess mortality rate than the United States. You don’t want to hear that. They don’t want to tell you that. Early and aggressive action saved millions of lives through operation warp speed. We will develop and distribute a vaccine in record time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","27:31"
"Donald Trump","We’re going to have it very, very soon. They’re very upset with the vaccine. They’re very upset with the vaccine because it’s happening too soon. They don’t want it now. Even though it’s saving lives, it’s going to save tremendous lives, they don’t want to hear it. They don’t want to hear about the therapies. They just want to get through the election. I heard one state… Did you hear this? We’re going to open up our schools on November 6th. Oh. I told you that, right? Don’t worry about it, Pennsylvania. Your state’s going to be open like on November 4th. This was some idiot. And now they’re excoriating this person that said it. They’re excoriating the person that said it. We’re to open up out of schools in November 6 to latest November 9th. Oh, that’s nice. Got to open your schools. You’ve got to open up your state.

"Donald Trump","The ones that are doing well are the ones that opened it up. We will crush the virus. Our opponents will crush America. And that’s what it’s about. They will. They will deliver a crippling shutdown and a steep. You will have… If sleepy Joe Biden becomes president, first of all, you’re going to have a massive tax increase. You’re going to see interest rates go through the ceiling. You will have a depression, the likes of which this country has never seen before. And I’m including 1929. That was a pretty bad one. All right. That’s what’s going to happen. I hope I don’t get a chance to be tested because I don’t want to be tested. I don’t want to have him and say, “See, I was right.” Because with us, you’re going to have incredible prosperity. We’re cutting taxes and we’re growing fast.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","29:23"
"Donald Trump","I’m delivering a safe vaccine in record time. That’s the other thing with the vaccine because of me and the FAA, they’re approving things in a fraction of the time. You wouldn’t have had a vaccine if you had to go through that obsolete process. You wouldn’t have had a vaccine for two and a half more years. On November 3rd, Pennsylvania will decide whether we end the pandemic, defeat the virus and return to record prosperity. Or whether we allow to sleepy Joe Biden to kill the recovery, delay the vaccine, impose a $4 trillion tax hike, destroy your suburbs. Everyone is talking about me and the suburbs. I knocked out the regulation that allows low-income housing in the suburbs. Then I hear oh, the people in the suburbs don’t like me. You better like me because you’re going to have… Your suburbs aren’t going to be so great. They say that women in the suburbs… I made the mistake. I said, “Housewives living in the suburbs.” They said, “Oh, that’s politically incorrect.” Okay. I got killed for that. I used the word housewife. Is that an unacceptable term? I don’t know.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","30:09"
"Donald Trump","They’re all saying no. I said the housewives in the suburbs. And they said, “Oh, what a horrible thing to say.” But women, let’s be politically correct, women and men in the suburbs, they’re changing the zoning so they can build. That’s what it is. They’re changing the zoning. It was a rule, a regulation that was a disaster. I called my people. I said, “I want to terminate it.” They said, “Sir, we can’t do that. Let’s just amend it. We’ll make it much…” “No, no. You don’t understand. I don’t want to amend it. I want to terminate it.” “Yes, sir.” And we terminated it. We terminated it. But if you believe the fake suburb polls, I don’t think people in the suburbs know that I did that. I don’t think they know that I did it. They say, “We want sleepy Joe Biden.” Why? Why do you want him? First of all, you’re not getting him. You’re getting this maniac who was falling like a rock in the polls. He picked somebody that he should have never picked. She was so bad to him. She said such bad things about him. I’m not going to pick somebody that says bad. Then on top of it, 15, 14, 13, 10, eight, seven. Then she went up back to eight. She had a big week. And then she went back down. She got out at one or two. She quit before Iowa, right? Then they had the Iowa primary. Because they used these crazy ballots, nobody ever found out who won. And now they want to use it on a scale that’s a thousand times bigger. 80 million ballots. 80 million ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","31:19"

And they took it away from the guy that was beating her or would have beat her. But they’re missing massive. It sounded like they’re missing 1%, which would be unacceptable. 1%, you can win by 1%, right? You can win by 1/10 of 1%. But they’re losing… Like there was one area I think 41% of the ballots were missing. 41. These people are crazy. This is going to be a disaster. And all I’m asking is people go out to vote. Go out to vote and stop with this nonsense because we’re going to be counting ballots for the next two years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","32:58"
"Donald Trump","I don’t want to end up in the Supreme Court, and I don’t want to go back to Congress either. Even though we have an advantage if we go back to Congress. Does everyone understand that? I think it’s 26 to 22 or something because it’s counted one vote per state. So we actually have an advantage. Oh, they’re going to be thrilled to hear that. I’m sure they’re trying to figure out how can we break that one? Biden wants to confiscate your guns and indoctrinate your children with poisonous anti-American lies in schools, right? To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools, I announced last week that we are launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We’ll teach our children the truth about America, that we are the most exceptional nation on the face of the earth. We are only getting better. We’re getting better. This is a healing for us. This is the most important election we’ve ever had. I’m telling you. I used to say like even a couple of months ago, well, how do you… Like 2016, that was pretty exciting. Right? Was that exciting? Was that the coolest night? Trump is winning Florida. He’s winning North Carolina. He’s winning Pennsylvania. He’s winning Michigan. He’s winning Wisconsin. He’s winning everything. What the hell is going on? And people crying. They’re crying. The anchors, the non-biased anchors are crying. I watched an interview with a person on MSBNC. I don’t watch it much, but I watched because sleepy Joe was on. She’s like, “Did you see that interview yesterday?” And she’s very tough. Very tough. She’s very nasty. She’s feeding him, can’t answer it. So what she’s doing is… “No, no, isn’t it true? Isn’t it true that Trump is a horrible human being?” Well, yeah. As we discussed before, it’s true. This was the worst, most obvious… And this was a killer. This person is very tough. It is so rigged. The whole thing is rigged. We got to beat the system, and we’re beating the system. Sometimes I’ll look and I’ll have somebody in the office that’s corrupt media person. And I’ll be sitting there complaining how unfair it is. Then I’ll be sitting in the Oval Office, but I’ll be saying how unfair it is. Then I’ll look around the Oval Office. I say, “Wait a minute. It’s unfair, but oh, we’re in the Oval Office and you’re not.” I stopped complaining, Mike. They said, “Oh, this is the Oval Office. Isn’t it?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","33:40"

His running mate urged supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out riders out of jail, including an attempted cop killer. Let’s get him out of jail. 13 members of Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. They donated a lot of money too. We want to get these people out. We want to be called in. You saw what we did in Minneapolis. She called us like a week and a half too late. We went in. How long did that take? About a half hour. It was over. We brought in the National Guard. We told Seattle we’re coming in and they left that night. We’re all set to go in. I was so disappointed.

A young man and they shot him and killed him, this one guy, this one animal. Two and a half … That’s right, over his hat. Not our hat, it was another hat, it was a Christian hat. It was a Christian hat, he was a Christian. He was a Christian, and they shot him, killed him instantly. This guy that shot him, everybody knew who he was, right?

But the U.S. Marshals … We can solve that problem so easy, we’d put them in there so easy, but they don’t want, the governor doesn’t want them. The governor wants to leave it that way.

China’s entry into the World Trade Organization which he said was a wonderful thing. No it wasn’t, it was a terrible thing. That’s when China took off like a rocket ship, but you know what, China was going to overtake us.

They’ll never ever … They have more people but they’ll never overtake you if you have somebody smart. Biden’s NAFTA and China deals wiped out one-third of your state’s manufacturing jobs.

You know, it’s interesting, we signed a great deal. The farmers have done more business in the last two or three weeks. Biggest corn orders ever. The biggest soybean, biggest cattle, biggest beef orders. But, you know, it doesn’t mean as much to me. The ink wasn’t even dry and the plague came over. Am I right? It wasn’t even dry, it just doesn’t mean what it would have meant. We made a great deal but it doesn’t mean the same anymore, because they could have stopped it from coming here.

You make millions of dollars a year on that. When we win, Pennsylvania wins, and America wins, and that’s what’s happening. For decades our politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars in areas and countries that you’d never even heard of, and defending foreign borders. Now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops back home to the USA where they belong.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-middletown-pa-rally-speech-transcript-sept-26-first-rally-after-scotus-nomination","Donald Trump Middletown, PA Rally Speech Transcript Sept 26: First Rally After SCOTUS Nomination","49:09"

"Donald Trump","Now our opponents are pledging to rejoin the job-killing Paris Climate Accord, a disaster for our country. It was meant to hurt us, it was meant really to take advantage of us. We would have spent trillions of dollars. You would have ended up closing a lot of your plants and factories. I said, “I’m going to do this, I’m going to get out of this crazy deal,” and I did. I said, “Oh, they’re going to kill me.” You know what, the people got it. They understood it. It was ripping off our country, because we have things that they don’t have, like unbelievable wealth under our ground. They don’t want us to use it. Oh, that’s nice, that’s a wonderful thing. Thank you very much. I withdrew from that catastrophe because I was elected to fight for Pennsylvania, not for Paris. We’re putting America first. It’s been a long time, right? From day one I put America first. To defend our workers I imposed tariffs on foreign aluminum and foreign steel. I saved our auto industry by withdrawing from the horrible Trans-Pacific Partnership.

They hadn’t built one in 42 years and we’re building a lot of them. We have countries, you want to do business with us, go in and build auto plants. I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement into law, which is great. You’re not going to be losing companies to Mexico and Canada, very disadvantageous for them to do that. I took the toughest ever action to stand up to China’s rampant theft of Pennsylvania’s jobs.

You know, he’s got one … Isn’t that the easiest job I’ve ever seen, they never have to work. The media, please go home. There won’t be any activity from sleepy Joe Biden today. He’s a low-energy individual. Now, you need a president with a lot of energy. You deal with President Xi of China, President Putin of Russia, Kim Jong-un. Remember we’re going to be in a war with North Korea, right? What happened? What happened to the war? A lot happened? We didn’t do anything, say anything. We didn’t do anything but millions of people could have been killed in that nuclear war, it probably would have been nuclear. But look at it.

By the way, many countries are coming and they’re all calling now. “We want to come in.” They’re going to all come in. No more blood in the sand. No, we just did it smart. We reversed it.

They’re sort of like the Palestinians and Israel. So, I have two, I have Kosovo and … You know, we’re dealing with both of them. I said to them, “Why are you fighting and killing each other?” They have a lot of differences, including a religious difference, I guess. I said, “What are you doing?” We trade with both, so we have certain power. So I said, “Listen, let’s get a deal. Let’s make economic peace, and ultimately peace.” They came to my office, the Oval Office, to sign. They were hugging. They were so, I mean it was a beautiful thing to see.

I just got nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, and we’re going to sit there and I’m going to just soak it in, Darling. Let’s turn on NBC fake news, Lester Holt.

"Donald Trump","When Obama got it nobody knew what he got it for, including him. Remember, they said, “What did you get it for?” “I don’t know.” That’s how different … We have to work harder. He got a Nobel Prize and he didn’t have any idea why he got it, and then he started dropping bombs two weeks later on some place that didn’t work out. It couldn’t work out because he had John Kerry negotiating, who was the worst incompetent. Now, it’s so sad that Iran, that horrible deal. That was a fast plane. That must’ve been one of the new ones we just bought. We have all new equipment, that was scary.

It was raining heavily in a certain area, and they did a story on something else, something else, and something else. Then they went into another story, then another, and then they had a commercial that lasted for about nine minutes. Even though they’re not supposed to make money, they’re using our free airwaves for fake news. Okay. They’re using free airwaves. Think about that. We’re thinking about that. We’re thinking about that. Why are they using free airwaves to give fake news? So it came toward the end, I said, “Darling, I’m a little embarrassed.” But the following day, I got nominated for another one. I called her up. I said, “Maybe they forgot.

Another one, another one, another one, got to the commercial, never ended, kept back a little tiny piece. And I said, ” They didn’t cover two Nobel prizes.” I got two in one week. Did you ever hear that one? For different things, totally unrelated.

That sucker’s dying. Boy, those magazines are going down fast. But he was on a fake magazine, Vanity Fair, I think. And he started saying about he had a good week, good week. And he started saying, “I was born to do this. I was born to run for president.” I said, “He’s not going to last very long.” And about two weeks later, it was over. He was put in charge of taking your guns away, though. Bye-bye, you know that, right? Beto, Beto, how do you get the name Beto? He made it a little Spanish because his last name is Beto O’Rourke.
