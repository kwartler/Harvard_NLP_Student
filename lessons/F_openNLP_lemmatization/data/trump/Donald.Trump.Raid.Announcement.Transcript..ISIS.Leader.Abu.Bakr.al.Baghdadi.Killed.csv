"Donald Trump","Last night, the United States brought the world’s number one terrorist leader to justice. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is dead. He was the founder and leader of ISIS, the most ruthless and violent terror organization anywhere in the world. The United States has been searching for Baghdadi for many years. Capturing or killing Baghdadi has been the top national security priority of my administration.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","00:21"
"Donald Trump","US special operations forces executed a dangerous and daring nighttime raid in northwestern Syria and accomplished their mission in grand style. The US personnel were incredible. I got to watch much of it. No personnel were lost in the operation, while a large number of Baghdadi’s fighters and companions were killed with him. He died after running into a dead end tunnel, whimpering and crying and screaming all the way.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","00:57"
"Donald Trump","The compound had been cleared by this time with people either surrendering or being shot and killed. 11 young children were moved out of the house and are uninjured. The only ones remaining were Baghdadi in the tunnel, and he had dragged three of his young children with him. They were led to certain death. He reached the end of the tunnel as our dogs chased him down. He ignited his vest killing himself and the three children. His body was mutilated by the blast. The tunnel had caved in on it in addition, but test results gave certain, immediate, and totally positive identification. It was him. The thug who tried so hard to intimidate others spent his last moments in utter fear, in total panic and dread, terrified of the American forces bearing down on him. We were in the compound for approximately two hours, and after the mission was accomplished, we took highly sensitive material and information from the raid, much having to do with ISIS origins, future plans, things that we very much want.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","01:39"
"Donald Trump","Baghdadi’s demise demonstrates America’s relentless pursuit of terrorist leaders and our commitment to the enduring and total defeat of ISIS and other terrorist organizations. Our reach is very long. As you know, last month we announced that we recently killed Hamza bin Laden, the very violent son of Osama bin Laden, who was saying very bad things about people, about our country, about the world. He was the heir apparent to Al-Qaida. Terrorists who oppress and murder innocent people should never sleep soundly, knowing that we will completely destroy them. These savage monsters will not escape their fate and they will not escape the final judgment of God. Baghdadi has been on the run for many years, long before I took office, but in my direction as Commander in Chief of the United States, we obliterated his caliphate 100% in March of this year.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","03:19"
"Donald Trump","Today’s events are another reminder that we will continue to pursue the remaining ISIS terrorists to their brutal end. That also goes for other terrorist organizations. They are likewise in our sites. Baghdadi and the losers who worked for him, and losers they are. They had no idea what they were getting into. In some cases, they were very frightened puppies. In other cases, they were hardcore killers, but they killed many, many people. Their murder of innocent Americans James Foley, Steven Sotloff, Peter Kassig, and Kayla Mueller were especially heinous. The shocking publicized murder of Jordanian pilot, a wonderful young man, spoke to the King of Jordan. They all knew him. They all loved him. He was burned alive in a cage for all to see, and the execution of Christians in Libya and Egypt as well as the genocidal mass murder of Yazidis rank ISIS among the most deprived organizations, the history of our world. The forced religious conversions, the orange suits prior to so many beheadings, all of which were openly displayed for the world to see. This was all that Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, this is what he wanted. This is what he was proud of. He was a sick and depraved man, and now he’s gone. Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way as a coward, running and crying.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","04:42"
"Donald Trump","This raid was impeccable and could only have taken place with the acknowledgement and help of certain other nations and people. I want to thank the nations of Russia, Turkey, Syria, and Iraq, and I also want to thank the Syrian Kurds for certain support they were able to give us. This was a very, very dangerous mission. Thank you as well to the great intelligence professionals who helped make this very successful journey possible. I want to thank the soldiers and sailors, airmen and Marines involved in last night’s operation. You are the very best there is anywhere in the world, no matter where you go. There is nobody even close. I want to thank General Mark Milley and our joint chiefs of staff, and I also want to thank our professionals who work in other agencies of the United States government and were critical to the missions. Unbelievable success.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","07:04"
"Donald Trump","Last night was a great night for the United States and for the world. A brutal killer one who has caused so much hardship and death has violently been eliminated. He will never again harm another innocent man, woman, or child. He died like a dog. He died like a coward. The world is now a much safer place. God bless America. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","08:18"

"Donald Trump","We’ve had him under surveillance for a couple of weeks. We knew a little bit about where he was going, where he was heading. We had very good information that he was going to another location he didn’t go. Two or three efforts were canceled because he decided to change his mind, constantly changing his mind. And finally we saw that he was here, held up here. We knew something about the compound. We knew it had tunnels. The tunnels were dead end for the most part. There was one we think that wasn’t, but we had that covered, too, just in case. The level of intelligence, the level of work was was pretty amazing. When we landed with eight helicopters, a large crew of brilliant fighters ran out of those helicopters and blew holes into the side of the building, not wanting to go through the main door because that was booby trapped.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","08:59"
"Donald Trump","And there was something … it was something really amazing to see. I got to watch it along with General Milley, Vice President Pence, others in the situation room, and we watched it so clearly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","10:03"

"Donald Trump","Well, I don’t want to say how, but we had absolutely perfect as though you were watching a movie. It was a … that in the technology there alone is really great. A big part of the trip that was of great danger was the … it was approximately an hour and 10 minute flight and we were flying over very, very dangerous territory. In fact, some of our leaders said that that could be the most dangerous flying in and flying out, and that’s why last night we were so quiet about it. We didn’t say anything and I didn’t make my remark until after they had landed safely in a certain area. But the flight in, the flight out was a very, very dangerous part. There was a chance that we would have met unbelievable fire.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","10:23"
"Donald Trump","Russia treated us great. They opened up. We had to fly over certain Russia areas, Russia-held areas. Russia was great. Iraq was excellent. We really had a great cooperation, and you have to understand they didn’t know what we were doing and where we were going exactly, but the ISIS fighters are hated as much by Russia and some of these other countries as they are by us, and that’s why I say they should start doing a lot of the fighting now, and they’ll be able to. I really believe they’ll be able to. Yes, Jennifer.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","11:16"

"Donald Trump","Turkey, we dealt with them. They knew we were going in. We flew over some territory. They were terrific. No problem. They were not problem. They could start shooting and then we will take them out, but a lot of bad things can happen, plus it was a very secret mission. We flew very, very low and very, very fast. [crosstalk 00:12:36] But it was a big, it was a very dangerous part of the mission getting in and getting out, too. Equal. We went in in identical, we took an identical route. We met with gunfire coming in, but it was local gunfire. That gunfire was immediately terminated. These people are amazing. They had the gunfire terminated immediately, meaning they were shot from the airships.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","12:12"

"Donald Trump","Well, I’ll tell you. The first day I came to office, and now we’re getting close to three years, I would say, “Where’s al-Baghdadi? I want al-Baghdadi.” And we would kill terrorist leaders, but they were names I’d never heard of. They were names that weren’t recognizable and they weren’t the big names. Some good ones, some important ones, but they weren’t the big names. I kept saying, “Where’s al-Baghdadi?” And a couple of weeks ago they were able to scope him out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","13:14"
"Donald Trump","These people are very smart. They’re not into the use of cell phones anymore. They’re not … they’re very technically brilliant. They use the Internet better than almost anybody in the world, perhaps other than Donald Trump, but they use the Internet incredibly well and what they’ve done with the Internet through recruiting and everything, and that’s why he died like a dog. He died like a coward. He was whimpering, screaming, and crying, and frankly I think it’s something that should be brought out so that his followers and all of these young kids that want to leave various countries, including the United States, they should see how he died. He didn’t die a hero. He died a coward crying, whimpering, screaming, and bringing three kids with him to die. Certain death, and he knew the tunnel had no end. I mean, it was a closed … closed-end … they call it a closed-end tunnel. Not a good place to be.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","13:45"

"Donald Trump","Well, this operation started two weeks ago in terms of the real operation because we had him scoped. We thought he’d be in a certain location. He was. Things started checking out very well. We were involved in on our own team with some brilliant people who I’ve gotten to know, brilliant people that love our country, highly intelligent people, and we’ve had it pretty well scoped out for a couple of weeks, but he tends to change immediately. He had a lot of cash. He tends to change on a dime where he’ll be going to a certain location. All of a sudden he’ll go someplace else and you’ll have to cancel.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","15:10"
"Donald Trump","But this was one where we knew he was there, and you can never be 100% sure because you’re basing it on technology more than anything else. But we thought he was there and then we got a confirmation, and when we went in they were greeted with a lot of firepower, a lot of fire firepower. I’ll tell you, these guys, they do a job.

A leak could have caused the death of all of them. Now they’re so good that I think nothing was going to stop them anyway, you want to know the truth. That’s how good they were.

No, we’re after these leaders and we have others in sight, very bad ones. But this was the big one. This is the biggest one perhaps that we’ve ever captured.

We’re out, but we are leaving soldiers to secure the oil and we may have to fight for the oil, that’s okay. Maybe somebody else wants the oil, in which case they have a hell of a fight. But there’s massive amounts of oil and we’re securing it for a couple of reasons. Number one, it stops ISIS because ISIS got tremendous wealth from that oil. We have taken it, it’s secured. Number two, and again, somebody else may claim it, but either we’ll negotiate a deal with whoever’s claiming it if we think it’s fair or we will militarily stop them very quickly.

"Donald Trump","You know, the airport is right nearby, a very big, very monstrous, very powerful airport and very expensive airport that was built years ago. We’re in that Middle East now for eight trillion dollars. So we don’t want to be keeping Syria and Turkey. They’re going to have to make their own decision. The Kurds have worked along incredibly with us, but in all fairness, it was much easier dealing with the Kurds after they went through three days of fighting because that was a brutal three days. And if we would’ve said to the Kurds, “Hey, do you mind moving over seven miles?” Because they were in the middle mostly. So you have seven or eight miles. “Could you mind moving over?” Because I have to say Turkey is taken tremendous deaths from that part of the world. We call it a safe zone, but it was anything but a safe zone.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","21:45"
"Donald Trump","Turkey has lost thousands and thousands of people from that safe zone. So they’ve always wanted that safe zone for many years. I’m glad I was able to help them get it, but we don’t want to be there. We want to be home. I want our soldiers home or fighting something that’s meaningful. I’ll tell you who loves us being there, Russia and China. Because while they build their military, we’re depleting our military there. So Russia loves us being there. Now, Russia likes us big there for two reasons because we kill ISIS, we kill terrorists and they’re very close to Russia. We’re 8,000 miles away. Now, maybe they can get here. But we’ve done very well with Homeland Security and the ban, which by the way is approved by the United States Supreme Court, as you know. You know, there was a reporter that said we lost the case and he was right in the early court.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","22:36"
"Donald Trump","He didn’t want to say … just refused to say that we won the case in the Supreme Court. But we have a very effective ban and it’s very hard for people to come to our country, but it’s many thousands of miles away whereas Russia’s right there. Turkey’s right there, Syria is there. They’re all right there, excuse me, Iran is right there. Iraq is right there. They all hate ISIS. In theory they should do something and I’ll give you something else. The European nations have been a tremendous disappointment because I personally called, but my people called a lot. Take your ISIS fighters and they didn’t want them. They said, “We don’t want them.” They came from France, they came from Germany, they came from the U.K. They came from a lot of countries and I actually said to them, “If you don’t take them. I’m going to drop them right on your border and you can have fun capturing them again.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","23:29"
"Donald Trump","But the United States taxpayer is not going to pay for the next 50 years. You see what Guantanamo costs? We’re not going to pay tens of billions of dollars because we were good enough to capture people that want to go back to Germany, France, U.K, and other parts of Europe. And they can walk back, they can’t walk to our country. We have lots of water in between our country and them. So yeah, go.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","24:26"
"Speaker 14","You mentioned that you’d met some, gotten to know some brilliant people along this process who had helped provide information and advice along the way. Is there anyone in particular, or would you like to give anyone credit for getting to this point today?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","24:54"
"Donald Trump","Well, I would but if I mentioned one, I have to mention so many. I spoke to Senator Richard Burr this morning and as you know, he’s very involved with intelligence and the committee and he’s a great gentleman. I spoke with Lindsey Graham just a little while ago. In fact, Lindsey Graham is right over here and he’s been very much involved in this subject. And he’s a very strong hawk, but I think Lindsey agrees with what we’re doing now. And again, there are plenty of other countries that can help them patrol. I don’t want to leave 1,000 or 2000 to 3000 soldiers on the border. But where Lindsey and I totally agree is the oil, the oil is so valuable for many reasons. It fueled ISIS, number one. Number two, it helps the Kurds because it’s basically been taken away from the Kurds. They were able to live with that oil. And number three, it can help us because we should be able to take some also.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","25:07"
"Donald Trump","And what I intend to do perhaps is make a deal with an Exxon Mobile or one of our great companies to go in there and do it properly. Right now it’s not big. It’s big oil underground, but it’s not big oil up top and much of the machinery has been shot and dead. It’s been through wars. And spread out the wealth. But no, we’re protecting the oil. We’re securing the oil. Now that doesn’t mean we don’t make a deal at some point, but I don’t want to be … they’re fighting for a thousand years. They’re fighting for centuries. I want to bring our soldiers back home, but I do want to secure the oil. If you read about the history of Donald Trump, I was a civilian. I had absolutely nothing to do with going into Iraq and I was totally against it, but I always used to say, “If they’re going to go in,” nobody cared that much, but it got written about, “If they’re going to go in,” and I’m sure you’ve heard the statement because I made it more then any human being alive. “If they’re going into Iraq, keep the oil.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","26:11"
"Donald Trump","They never did. They never did. I know Lindsay Graham had a bill where basically we would have been paid back for all of the billions of dollars that we’ve spent. Many, many billions of dollars. I mean, I hate to say it, it’s actually trillions of dollars, but many, many billions of dollars. And by one vote they were unable to get that approved in the Senate. They had some pretty big opposition from people that shouldn’t have opposed, like a president and they weren’t able. If you did that, Iraq would be a much different story today because they would be owing us a lot of money. They would be treating us much differently, but I will say Iraq was very good with respect to the raid last night.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","27:14"

"Donald Trump","Yeah. We thought for three days this is what was going to happen. It was actually, look, nobody was even hurt, a K-9 as they call, I call it a dog, a beautiful dog. A talented dog was injured and brought back. But we had no soldier injured and they did a lot of shooting and they did a lot of blasting. Even not going through the front door. You’d think, you go through the door. If you’re a normal person, you say, “Knock, knock, may I come in?” The fact is that they blasted their way into the house and a very heavy wall and it took them literally seconds. By the time those things went off, they had a beautiful big hole and they ran in and they got everybody by surprise. Unbelievably brilliant as fighters. I can’t imagine there could be anybody better. And these, as you know, are our top operations people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","28:04"

"Donald Trump","Well, we don’t know that, but he was the last one out and his people had either been killed, which there were many or gave up and came out. Because with the 11 children that came out, we were able to do that. We don’t know if they were his children. They might’ve been, but as I said, three died in the tunnel and the tunnel collapsed with the explosion. But you had other fighters coming out also and they’re being brought back. They’re right now … we have them imprisoned.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","29:08"

"Donald Trump","Well, I started five o’clock, we were pretty much gathered at five o’clock yesterday. We were in contact all day long through hopefully secure phones. I’ll let you know tomorrow, but nothing seemed to leak, so I guess they were secure for a change. But we gathered more or less at 5:00. The attack started moments after that. The liftoff started moments after that. Again, the element of attack that they were most afraid of was getting from our base into that compound. Because there’s tremendous firepower that we were flying over. And I won’t go into it, but you had a very big Russian presence in one area. You had a Turkish presence, you had a Syrian presence and you’re flying low, it’s very dangerous. And there were shots made, but we think these were people that were shooting, that were indiscriminately shooting. The helicopters took some shots, but we think that these were people that were just random people that don’t like to see helicopters, I guess.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","29:48"

"Donald Trump","So that’s another part of the genius of these people. They brought his … they have his DNA, more of it than they want even. And they brought it with them with lab technicians who were with them and they assumed that this was Baghdadi. They thought visually it was him, but they assumed it was him. And they did a site, an onsite test. They got samples. And to get to his body they had to remove a lot of debris because the tunnel had collapsed. But these people are very good at that. And they, as I said, they brought body parts back with them, et cetera. There wasn’t much left, the vest blew up, but they’re still substantial pieces that they brought back. So they did an onsite test because we had to know this and it was a very quick call that took place about 15 minutes after he was killed. And it was positive, “This is a confirmation, sir.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-raid-announcement-transcript-isis-leader-abu-bakr-al-baghdadi-killed","Donald Trump Raid Announcement Transcript: ISIS Leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Killed","31:05"

"Donald Trump","So there are two women, there were two women. Both wives, both wearing vests. They had not detonated, but the fact that they were dead and they had vests on made it very difficult for our men.

"Donald Trump","Yeah, we know the successors and we’ve already got them in our sights and we’ll tell you that right now, but we know the successors. Hamza bin Laden was a big thing, but this is the biggest there is. This is the worst ever. Osama bin Laden was very big, but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center. This is a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, a country, a caliphate and was trying to do it again. And I had not heard too much about his health.
