"Melania Trump","Hello, Florida. It is wonderful to be here in our home state. Thank you for taking the time to be here and for supporting the administration. We love you too. For those of you who are still deciding who to vote for on Tuesday, I hope that what I have to say would prove to you that a vote for President Trump is a vote for a better America. In a time when hate, negativity, and fear are the messages the media streams into our homes and the large tech companies are protecting political censorship, we need to remember what is really important. My husband’s administration is focused on the future. The health and safety of the American people, the education and wellbeing of our children, the safety and security of our streets and communities, and the protection of our fundamental family values.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:59"
"Melania Trump","Under Donald’s leadership, we have blocked out the noise and focused on you, the American people. Under my husband’s leadership, our nation is respected again, our borders are safer, we have won wars, and we have stayed out of new conflicts. We have made historic peace deals in the Middle East. We didn’t just talk about it, we moved our embassy to Jerusalem. The president stands with our friend, Israel, more than any other president before. Our allies are now doing their fair share globally. Our economy soared and unemployment shrunk. Our military is stronger than ever. Opportunities for women and especially working mothers expanded in our work force. Healthcare for every citizen remains a priority for him. And as you have seen over these past years, he won’t stop until he gets it done.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","03:37"
"Melania Trump","We have a law an order president. Donald fights to protect and support all our people. He also fully supports our men and women in uniform while others are calling to defund them. We have faith in our judges and our legal system to rule justly. We respect our heritage and we condemn all hate. We should always learn from our past. And it is more important than ever that we never forget it. Under this president, our American values and ideals are protected, cherished, and upheld. We have had three incredible years of making America great again. In early 2020, our …","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","05:13"

"Melania Trump","In early 2020, our nation began feeling the effects of a global pandemic, a virus that invaded our nation. And no one really understood. Now, because of our amazing medical capabilities and resources, we are in the process of developing powerful therapeutics and vaccine. A vaccine is not a partisan issue. If you are not supporting the safe production of a vaccine, you’re not supporting the health and safety of the American people. There is no room to play politics on this topic in the midst of pandemic. I want to take this moment to say thank you to the many amazing frontline workers who are with us today. Thank you for all that you are doing. You keep our most vulnerable citizens safe. Our administration fully supports you and will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that you are equipped with all the medical supplies you need. This administration also continue working to develop safer procedures and practices so that children can get back in the classroom. So that businesses can continue reopening and people can start earning an income again. This president and his team are focused on not only destroying the virus and building back the economy, they’re focused on the creating ways for people to safely stop isolating and start gathering with friends again on a safe distances. This is about mental health as much as it is physical. We are a country of hope, not a country of fear or weakness. And we have a leader who shows us that every single day. President Trump chooses to move this country forward. This country deserves a president with proven results, not empty words and promises. On Tuesday, the direction our country will take is in your own hands. I ask that you join us in continuing to put America first. Together, we will overcome this pandemic and continue building the brightest future for generations to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","06:47"

And America is blessed to have you. Thank you very much, honey. That was great. So I’m thrilled to be here in my, our, home state, Florida. I love this state and I love the people of this state. And five days from now, we are going to win Florida and we are going to win four more years in the White House. And we’re going on to win a record share of the Hispanic American vote. You see what’s happening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","11:27"
"Donald Trump","Ah, they’re very concerned back there. The fake news, they are so concerned. Melania, you don’t know too much about them. You’ve seen enough. But they are very unhappy. You know what’s happening, don’t you? You see what’s happening? We’ve led Florida every single day. What’s going on? This is a terrible thing for them. Actually, it’s a good thing for them. They just don’t know it. They haven’t quite figured that out yet. No, we’re doing incredibly in Florida. We’re doing incredibly all over. And this isn’t based on polls, this is based on facts. This is based on votes that are coming in. But you have to get out and vote. We are creating the greatest red wave in the history of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","12:24"
"Donald Trump","Oh, it’s been amazing. We’ll talk about it a little while. I want to get some of the little introductions and introductory things out, but we have to talk about what’s going on in our country with the big tech, the power of big tech. They’re incredible. They’re incredible. No, no, no. I heard about the power for a long time. The power of big tech. I heard about it four years ago. “Sir, big tech is against you. They’re tremendously powerful. You can’t beat them.” Then we had the election and we won. I said, “Oh, how did that happen?” And the fake news media, 94% of the stories about us are negative. Think of it. Think of it. 64% of the stories about Sleepy Joe are positive. How the hell do you have a positive story about this guy? How do you have a positive story about him?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","13:12"
"Donald Trump","This election is a choice between my plan to deliver historics. And you know what this is going to be, right? Historic. This is historic prosperity. Another major tax cut to go along with the biggest tax cut in the history of our country. And record job growth. And Joe Biden’s plan is to deliver punishing lockdown. She’s going to lock you down. And Florida’s all opened up. You have a great governor. Did he speak too long today or not? No? No, I watched him on the plane. I said, “Oh, look, there’s Ron.” They have the little thing in the box. I said, “Oh look, there’s Ron. He’s speaking.” He looked like he was up there a long time. She said yes. He’s a great governor. You have a great governor. He’s a great guy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","14:04"
"Donald Trump","They want to give you massive tax hikes. The first time that I’ve ever seen … I’ve been with politics all my life, essentially. Only doing this for a few years on this side of it. But we’ve done well, haven’t we? What do you think? A senator came into my office, said, “Sir.” An older guy, nice guy, pro, total pro. “Sir, I’ve been in nine races and I’ve won seven of them. So now I’m a United States Senator.” I said, “Senator, I’ve been in one race and I’ve won one. Now we want to win two. But I won one. But it was the presidency.” We took them all by surprise, didn’t we? We took them by surprise. They’re still trying to recover.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","14:58"
"Donald Trump","And you will have a crippling depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen, if Sleepy Joe becomes your president. And your 401Ks, throw them out the window because you know what’s going to happen. And you know our stock market has a big headwind. The headwind is if he wins, and we are doing great. You see the number today? 33.1 GDP. The biggest in the history of our country by almost triple, right? Almost triple. Now it’s very much bigger than any GDP we’ve ever had. You have to go back to the 1950s, and then it’s less than half. This is the greatest number, 33.1%. If you asked me two weeks ago, I would’ve said I’ll take 12%. 12% would have been very nice. Nobody ever heard of 12%. 33.1. And let me tell you what they’re going to do. I never even thought of this one. They won’t even talk about it. This is the biggest event in business in 50 years. Nobody’s ever seen a number like this. This is bigger than any nation. No nation has a number like that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","15:44"
"Donald Trump","Other nations right now, they’re … Look, we were compared to Europe. Germany is doing so well, France is doing so well, everyone’s doing so well. No, they’re not doing well. And you take a look at what’s going on. And we want the best for them, we’re on their team. We want to work with them and everything else, but they’re not doing well. They’re spiking up big, they’re shutting down, they’re locking down. I disagree with that because we’re never going to lockdown again. We locked down, we understood the disease. And now we’re open for business. And that’s what it is. And that’s what it is. This explosive economic growth is four times greater than what the experts expected. They expected a number that would be like 7%, 8%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","16:52"
"Donald Trump","But here’s what’s going to happen. You’re going to go back home. You’re going to say, “That was incredible. Melania was unbelievable. The governor was incredible. I’ve never heard anybody speak like that. Trump was okay too. But we have no choice. We have to vote for Trump because it’s between Trump and Sleepy Joe. And anybody beats Sleepy Joe.” I can take a couple of these guys, they’re friends of mine. They’re not good people. They’re better than Joe. I will tell you. Now, do you believe what I’m running against? I’m running against the worst candidate in the history of presidential politics. I don’t care. Win, lose, or draw. This is the worst candidate in the history. He shouldn’t be there. Because Pocahontas kept going instead of getting out. Then it would have been against Bernie, which would have been fine too. You know what? You would have had a more energetic base if we had Bernie. That’s one thing. Because I don’t know if they have a base.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","17:35"
"Donald Trump","Here’s what’s happened. He goes for a speech. They’re showing you thousands. And look, as far as all the way back to that building, as far as the eye can see. And Biden is leaving his basement today, he took the lid off. You know what he does? He takes the lid off, runs to the closest part of Delaware, like if he can get a little piece of Pennsylvania. People in Pennsylvania are wise to him. They know all about his no fracking, no fracking, no fracking. Then he gets to Pennsylvania. He learns it’s a million jobs. And by the way, Pennsylvania, they give us that you can fire up your factories. They give us the energy. And it’s inexpensive energy. So he goes to Pennsylvania. All of a sudden, he changes. “Yeah, so I have nothing against fracking.” And the press doesn’t call him out on it. Right? And they don’t call them out on where’s Hunter? They don’t call him out, where’s Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Is Hunter in the crowd? They don’t call him out. They don’t call him out on where’s Hunter?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","18:34"
"Donald Trump","It’s crazy. It’s crazy. Some people said, I get a call from all the experts, right? Guys that ran for president six, seven, eight times. Never got past the first round, but they’re calling me up, “Sir, you shouldn’t be speaking about Hunter. You shouldn’t be saying bad things about Biden because nobody cares.” I disagree. Maybe that’s why I’m here and they’re not. But they say, ” Talk about your economic success. Talk about 33.1%, the greatest in history.” Now, look, if I do, I mean, how many times can I say it? I’ll say it five or six times during the speech. 33.1.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","19:44"
"Donald Trump","But you look at that and you look at Tucker Carlson, what he did the other night. Great. Great. And followed up by Sean and followed up by Laura. And the next day, nothing at all, right? Nothing. Nothing in the New York Times, the fake New York Times. Hey, how about Anonymous? Did we see Anonymous? A low staffer. Anonymous turned out to be a guy. I’m trying to figure out, I don’t know who the hell this guy is. So the New York Times said, “A senior white house official.” Nobody knew who he was. Look, we are in big trouble with the press. They are truly the enemy of the people. They are the enemy of the people.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","20:45"

This low life goes out and he writes a book. By the way, when he left, he had nothing but praise for the Trump. Oh, it’s incredible. Incredible. Then somebody gets him at the New York Times, the fake New York Times. And all of a sudden, he becomes nasty and he writes. And they say, “A top White House official.” Well, he was a staffer, low, had nothing to do with the White House. He had nothing to do. And he goes in, and you know what? There should be major criminal liability for some scum like this.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","21:39"
"Donald Trump","And for a year, everybody walks into my office, Secretary of State Pompeo. I could name every one of them, all good people. I’m looking at them and say, “I wonder if that could be the one.” And it turns out to be this low life that nobody knows who the hell he is. He had nothing to do with us. I don’t think I ever met him. And I might’ve met him. I think somebody said he has a picture of me standing someplace. This is a disgrace to our country. It shouldn’t happen. And he should be prosecuted. Are you listening to me back in Washington? He should be prosecuted along with the New York Times because it was a story made up, it was fake news made up by the New York Times. And you know who he works for now? CNN. He works for CNN Right there. See the camera right there with the light that just went off? See that, honey? That red light just went off. Fake news, CNN.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","22:19"

I would think CNN would be firing him for that, but this is a real low life. You know who else he works for? Google. He works for Google. I think Google should fire him very quickly because bad things are going to happen to him. But think of what he does to our government. Right? It’s like a horrible, treasonous, horrible thing that you can do this and you can get away with it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","23:18"
"Donald Trump","Weekly jobless claims, this is boring but it’s really good, just hit a seven month low. In other words, from the beginning of the pandemic seven months ago. We’re going to have next year the best year we’ve ever had economically. And it’s true. Biden is holding back the stock market because it’s an election, crazy things can happen. Maybe 100% of the people in Florida decide not to vote. You never know. But we have a headwind. So it’s gone down a little bit over the last few days because you’re coming close. And it could be. We’re going to win this election so big. You watch. You watch. We’re going to win so big. And that’s the only reason the market’s going down. The market’s going down because if he gets in, seriously, you’re going to have one of the worst depressions we’ve ever had. You’re going to have. And John Roberts from Fox is back there.

"Donald Trump","He agrees. And John Roberts is very unhappy because he doesn’t want his 401K to go down the tubes. No, John’s treated us very fairly. Not perfect. He’s not perfect, I will say, but he’s been overall pretty good. He’s pretty good. So, CNN, Google, we got to do something about all of it. New York Times is fake. It’s fake. They write so many fake stories. Thanks to our policies, America is experiencing the fastest and biggest recovery. We’re having the best recovery anywhere in the world. No other country, small or large is recovering like us. Think of that. In the past five months, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs, the fastest job growth in the history of our country. Our job growth has been 23 times faster than the first five months under Obama/Biden recovery, which was, by the way, the worst recovery since the Great Depression.

"Donald Trump","And just so you know, because all Biden does is talks about COVID. Right? He doesn’t call it the China virus. You know why? Because China has him paid off. He can’t use that term. They gave his son one and a half billion to manage. He makes millions of dollars a year, I assume. Right? The smartest guys in Wall Street said, “No, sir, that could not have happened. We can’t get it.” No, took him about, what, 10 minutes? He walked in, he walked out with one and a half billion. Hey, maybe he’s not so stupid after all. Right? That’s the only thing. I thought he was so dumb. Maybe he’s not as dumb as we think. Look, he cannot take on China. I didn’t say anything. I didn’t say… The biggest story, no, the second biggest story, the worst was when they spied on my campaign and they got caught. That’s the biggest political corruption story in the history of our country, but this could very well be second. And we have what’s called the laptop from hell, the laptop from hell. From what I’ve understood, you only have seen a tiny portion of it, but you know what the press is now doing? They’re blaming Russia. It’s Russia did it. Russia is the one that created the laptop. And Russia brought it into that little shop to have it fixed. Russia. I think Russia’s looking at us, they’re saying, “Those people are stone cold crazy. This is…” No, it was Russia’s fault.

Hey, how great do we love those people that took down the language, professional military people, word for word for word. If I didn’t have it, it would have been my word against shifty Schiff. Right? Eight times he said quid pro quo. Think of what that means. Eight times you’ve asked for the same thing.

I’d rather have you stay right where you are. You’re doing a good job of defending me.” But think of it, what we had to do, and we got 197 to nothing in the House. Think of that. 197 to nothing.

You look at our numbers, look at our recovery, fastest recovery. We went down ,the least economically went down by [inaudible 00:08:57]. As much as it’s painful and terrible, we went down the least. We’ve done an incredible job. It was projected that we would lose 2.2 million people. Right? The projections were 2.2 million. By the way, we shouldn’t have lost one person.

Other than that, he’s doing a wonderful job. Could you imagine losing to this guy? Could you imagine? Our First Lady will have to say, “Darling, I don’t know. This is impossible.” But you have to be very careful when you say that. Whenever I say anything that even uses the word losing, the fake news said, “He is thinking about losing. This is a big story. President Trump thinks she’s going to lose.” No, I don’t. I don’t. I think you’re going to lose, and I think you’ve lost all credibility.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","35:18"

It’s socialism. I used to say Venezuela on steroids. This would be, if they got in, a very, very, very large version of Venezuela, and it can happen with the Green New Deal and all these crazy… Look, AOC plus three, I heard she’s very insulted that I call her AOC. I’m not. I call her AOC plus three. That’s the three characters that… Ilhan Omar. I’m going to win Minnesota because of Ilhan Omar. She tells us how to run our country. She’s telling us how to run our country. I don’t think so. Ilhan Omar.

"Donald Trump","But when they called us, how long did it take? 25 minutes? It was extinguished. We could have done it the first hour instead of waiting for a week and a half. But the governors, they have to call, and I give the governor credit. He eventually called, He eventually called. They should call us, I’ll tell you, Oregon. They should call us in Portland. Oh, would I love to go in with the anarchists. They would last 15 minutes. Our guys, you got to hold them back. They want to… ” Let us in, sir. We’d like to go in.” I meet them. I see troops. “Sir, we’d like to go into Oregon. We’ll take care of it.” I say, “Just calm down. Just calm down.” It wouldn’t take them long. It would take them about 15… How long? And then we’d, well, we’d do things, and then, eventually, they’ end up going home about 10 years later, back home to mom and dad where they started in the basement.

That’s not an idea.” Didn’t he call the United States, he called the United States an idea, too. I said, “No, no, it’s not an idea. The United States is a great nation. That’s what it is. It’s not an idea.” He called us an idea, so he puts us in the same category as Antifa. As long as I am president, America will never be a socialist country, and I say it all the Time.

Within two days they were saying, the fake news, “She did magnificently well against Mike Pence.” No, no. No. That’s what happens. You do great, great, great. Two days later, you realize they have it down that you lost now. Mike did fantastically. He’s a great vice president. He works very hard. I’ll tell you one thing. His kids are in the military, and they’re teachers. I guarantee you one thing, Mike Pence has not made hundreds of millions of dollars by scamming foreign countries, because that’s what they’ve done.

Are you okay? Oh, look, they’re hitting the press. That’s okay. Oh, there go the cameras. There goes a million dollars worth of equipment. Look at that. Wow. That’s cool, actually. And I’ll tell the media, “I have nothing to do with that,” but it is cooling. I’m feeling a little… It’s amazing. It’s amazing. And I say it all the time, because we’ve liked Ronald Reagan, we’ve liked a lot of… Mostly they’re stiffs. Mostly. Generally speaking, they don’t do the job. Right? But we’ve had good ones like Ronald Reagan. He’s the one I think about. But nobody ever chanted… First of all, he’d never get a crowd like this. He’d have two or 300 people, they’d be in a ballroom.

It’s the love for our country. But there’s never been a chance we love you… I’m watching this guy here. He looks like he could take on anybody in the world. He’s a big, strong guy. I don’t think he’s ever cried in his life before, and I see him wiping away tears. We love you. We love you. This guy, he hasn’t cried since he was a baby and probably didn’t cry then either, and now he’s crying. No, there has never been that chance before, and I appreciate it. And I’m crying. That’s why I ended early. I’m crying, except I don’t want them to say, “You’re president broke down in tears today.” I don’t know. That’s not cool.

I will say, three weeks ago, they ordered more corn, more soy beans, more beef than at any time in the history of this country, so they obviously think I’m going to win. They obviously think we’re going to win, and they want to make us happy, but we’re not happy because that should have been stopped. And it’s not. Here, all over the world, you see what’s going on.

"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. There’s a lot of people … Look where that crowd is. Would you like to change places with some people in the back? I don’t think so. Thank you. Thank you. That’s incredible. What a crowd. But they’re all like this. I tell you, no matter where you go, 35,000, 45,000. They never mention it. They never mention. But with Biden, they never mention it either. I said, “Show the crowd.” You know what? They have circles. Someday, I’m going to hire the guy that does those circles. No, because it’s really good. Big, thick, nice circles. They’re perfectly done. It’s the best part of his campaign, the circles. And usually he’s got five of them. Usually he can’t fill them up with people, so he puts the fake news in the circles.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:02:33"
"Donald Trump","And then they don’t ask him questions. Or how about the question they asked him the other day? He’s walking out with ice cream. “Sir, what flavor ice cream is it?” “I don’t know. It’s vanilla, I think.” Then they asked him a real question, he ran into the car, went back to the basement. Does he have the lid on again today? Almost every day. How do you put the lid? You know, when you do the lid, he did it like five, six days recently, that’s like 50% of the campaign. Now they try and say it’s because of COVID. They say the fact that he has nobody at all show up is because of COVID. No, it’s because nobody shows up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:03:16"
"Donald Trump","And I think that’s the ultimate poll, and based on the numbers that we’re getting, we’re going to do really well on Tuesday. We’ll see. Who knows? It’s an election. And if we do win, you’re going to see a stock market that goes through the roof. Your 401ks are going to go up by 50% quickly. You watch. I’m telling you. We know. I know all those guys. They’re just petrified at the thought of having massive tax increases, regulation increases. They said, “We’ve been through that. It wasn’t good.” That’s why they had no growth. That’s why they had no recovery. Slowest ever. Remember I said that. Slowest since 1929. That’s a long time.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:03:54"
"Donald Trump","Not only is Joe Biden corrupt, he’s unfit. He has no plan to end the epidemic. It’s all talk, no action, like I said at the debate. 91% to 9%. You know what that means? They did polls afterwards. 91%. A respected poll, 91% said … I have to do it. I have to brag. You know why? They’ll never do it. Do you know the expression? If you can’t get anybody else to do it, do it yourself. No. 91% to 9%. I’m trying to figure out who was the nine. I want to find who these people were. No, it was just a ridiculous. Ridiculous. I think they could have done better, but you know, you never know. Again, this is why.

"Donald Trump","His policies would create a depression, and he wants you to surrender our country. That’s what he wants to do. He wants you to surrender our country to China, to all of these other countries that have taken total advantage of us. It’s really the reason I’m here. If it weren’t for the horrible trade deals with South Korea, with our allies, you know, our allies in many ways treat us worse than the enemy. The enemy, at least we have our guard up. Our allies, what they’ve done to us in terms of military protection and trade is disgraceful.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:05:18"

You see, Germany said it the other day, and I have roots in Germany. But Germany said it the other day, they like Barack Hussein Obama. And they should, because Germany is delinquent in their NATO payments. Very delinquent. They’re at a half a level, and they’re very rich. They can do whatever they want. It’s not like they don’t have the money. And I call them out. I say, “If you don’t pay, we’re going to start taking our troops out.” And these people go crazy. They go crazy. You watch.

We have these very expensive boards that come along, and this is largely a woman that comes from this area. Her husband happens to be a Major League Baseball player. Do you know who I’m talking about? He’s a handsome guy, but she’s far more beautiful, and he’s on Tampa Bay, so he’s right now a little depressed.

"Kayleigh McEnany","Joe Biden censored zero times notably. No, because we’re taking our message directly to the American people. We’ll be making five rally stops a day. Five. Thousands show up. Literally we had 25,000 people show up in Omaha. These are historic crowds. The President takes his message directly to the American people, and shame on Jack Dorsey. As the New York Post noted today, this is a mob artist. This is a shakedown effort to say, “Delete the Hunter Biden story. The media won’t report on it. Social media will censor it. Delete it, or we will censor the fourth newspaper in the United States. We will block them from social media. Big tech needs to be handled, and this president, a second term, will do just that, because there needs to be equity. There needs to be a lack of censorship.

Your churches will be closed. You won’t have social gatherings. It will be a lockdown versus President Trump, where we are safely reopening this country. Americans deserve jobs. They deserve freedom. Joe Biden’s modeling his strategy, which is lock down in the basement, but this president has surged therapeutics and testing and a vaccine in record time. We can control this, but at the same time, we can open this country and not lock down like Joe Biden will do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:08:06"
"Kayleigh McEnany","That’s right. It’s their livelihood. These are small businesses. People who have worked their entire lives to open these shops, these businesses, and then on top of that, you have 30 police officers who are injured on the first night of the riots. One run over by a car. Chants to stuff police officers in trunks. A vehicle with explosive devices. Let me be crystal clear why this is happening. It’s because Democrats have enabled the mob. When they attack our police officers verbally, it ends up that they end up being attacked physically. It’s called, what Jim Comey said, the Ferguson effect. And we’re seeing it play out yet again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:08:41"

"Kayleigh McEnany","No, the president’s approach is therapeutics, which by the way, have given us the lowest case fatality rate in the world, far lower than Europe’s. Right now, when you look across the hospitals in the United States, the percentage of COVID patients in hospital beds is 6%. it’s because this president did things right. You have a 99% survival rate under 70, and above 70, because of our therapeutics, it’s very close to that because of what this president did, tearing down bureaucratic barriers, tearing down regulations, paving the way for therapeutics.

Under my administration, we’re reversing the damage that Joe Biden and his group have done over a 47 year period. We’re bringing the pharmaceutical industry back here and back to regions of Puerto Rico. They took it out of Puerto Rico, devastating Puerto Rico. Joe Biden voted to eliminate those jobs and to send them to China and we’re reversing that and we’ve been reversing it now for over two years and it’s moving very rapidly. Last month, I also announced $13 billion in disaster relief for Puerto Rico. They got hit hard. They’re in a little path that causes problems. You know that right? Lot of hurricane problems. Speaking of hurricanes, you have a lot of hurricane problems too, and I’m always there. Ron, am I always there? Ron calls up, “Sir, I’d like to speak to you.” What is it about? Another hurricane? Yes. How many billion do you need, Ron? But I’m always there. And Rick, I’ll tell you what, Rick Scott’s been great. He’s been great. And Marco Rubio has been great.

"Donald Trump","Very strong guys, strong leaders. Good guys, too. Really good guys. Marco and Rick, you have great people here, great leadership. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in United States history. And we have now built over 400 miles of wall. And we’ll have it finished very shortly. It’ll be finished very soon. You don’t hear about it anymore. You used to hear when they didn’t think I’d be able to pull it off and that was a tough one. They were willing to close up the country over the wall. So I had a party, totally strong party, bad politics, but strong party. Bad policy, but they didn’t want a wall. But I made a really terrible mistake. I should have said instead of we will build a wall, I should have said, “We will not build a wall,” and they would have given me all the money. They would’ve said, “We demand that you build it immediately.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:17:56"
"Donald Trump","But then they said, “Walls don’t work.” And I said, “No walls work and wheels work. Those are the two things that work.” Everything else gets obsolete in about 15 minutes after it’s discovered. Biden wants to terminate our travel bans and surge refugees from the most dangerous places in the world. He will open the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. And you saw what happened three days ago, the beheading in France, and today it happened again. And we give our warmest regards to President McCrone, a friend of ours, a friend of mine, a friend of the first lady. They’re two great people. First lady of France is a great woman. Under the Biden plan, the horrifying attacks in France will come to our cities and our towns. And I don’t want to speak too loudly about this and I knock on wood. This is real wood. This is real wood. I can tell anything having to do with the White House and the president’s real wood somewhere. Oh yeah, here, let me knock on this piece. That’s definitely.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:18:53"
"Donald Trump","Look at what’s happened long time, right. I don’t want to say long time. And the first call I get after we win, the first call I get will be from Iran. They’re going to want to make a deal because their country has been devastated. They have been unable to give money to terrorist organizations that they’ve given routinely for years. Their GDP is down 27% this year, which is the highest anybody’s ever seen of any country in one year. Think of it. We’re up 33.1 and they’re down 27 and they’re going to want to make a deal and we want to make a deal if we can. We want them to be a great country, but they cannot have a nuclear weapon. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. And we’re going to help them. We’re going to help them. We’re going to go with them and help them and do whatever we have to do and I hope happens, but I believe that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:20:06"
"Donald Trump","And I even said, “Don’t deal with them now. They’re going to want to see what happens with Sleepy Joe,” because if he won, China will own us. Iran will make another crazy deal where they give them 150 billion or 1.8 billion in cash. Think of that. We have so many things that what we’ve done, the deals that we’ve made. It’s very scary to see. I watch it and I say, “There has to be something wrong because nobody can be that stupid. Nobody can be that stupid.” Under my leadership, we’re keeping the terrorist, extremist, and violent criminals the hell out of our country if that’s okay, if that’s okay with you. Some of you might object because you have that nice liberal point of view, but if that’s okay with you, we’ll keep them the hell out. We invested $2.5 trillion in the US military, including 11.2 million. Figure this, $11.2 million right here MacDill Air Force Base. Has anybody heard of MacDill? Has anybody in the audience? Mr. Congressman, you’re the one that got it in [inaudible 00:07:05]. Waltz. And we also passed veteran’s choice and veteran’s accountability. They all said it was impossible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:20:58"
"Donald Trump","They said it was impossible. And we took 100% of the ISIS caliphate, destroyed it. And we killed the leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who they were looking for for 17 years. Al-Baghdadi is dead. And then we took out the world’s number one terrorist by far, the worst in 50 years, Qasem Soleimani is dead. He killed many of our soldiers. He killed many soldiers from many continents, most feared man in the Middle East. He’s gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s horrible Iran nuclear deal. I recognized the capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem and got the building built for a tiny fraction. You know that story, right? Tiny fraction. I called up our great ambassador, David Friedman. I said, “David, let’s see if we can get it open.” They wanted to spend $2 billion to build an embassy and it would have never happened. I said, “David, go around. Do we have any land that we own? We’re the government. We own everything, right, even in other countries. See what we have.” He calls me back the following day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:22:15"
"Donald Trump","He says, “Sir, we own a great piece, much better than the piece they were going to buy.” We didn’t buy it because I didn’t like it. I didn’t like the location. Does that make sense because I’m in the real estate business? I didn’t like location. Location’s very important. I said, “See what we have.” He said, “Sir, we have a piece that’s much bigger. It’s in a much better location and it has a building.” Now remember, we’re going to spend between a billion and $2 billion. I said, “Well, what’s the building?” He said, “The building is a building that’s basically unoccupied. It’s pretty big. We could fix it up.” I said, “How much?” He said, “Let me get back to you.” He gets back to me two days later. Sir, I think we could do it for 390,000, right. Right. Do you understand that Mr. Congress? So I said, “It’s the first time I’ve ever done this.” I said, “David, that doesn’t sound good. It sounds too cheap. Make it a little more, make it 500.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:23:37"
"Donald Trump","And we did. We did it for 500,000 and it’s Jerusalem. And a friend of mine, Ron Baron, he’s so proud of a wall opposite the elevator. Every time I walk in he shows me Jerusalem stone. I go crazy. Ron, I don’t care. I said, “David, you’re in Jerusalem. It’s very expensive in New York. Can you get Jerusalem stone?” He said, “Yes we can. We have it. We can buy it for nothing.” I said, “Good. Make the building out of Jerusalem stone.” So he made it out of Jerusalem stone. We had it opened four months later for $500, 000. Not only would it have cost more than $2 million, you wouldn’t have that building built for 25 years. So we did something a little different. We got something done for a tiny, tiny fraction of what it was supposed to cost. And we had it open in three and a half, four months. And it’s now our embassy. It’s a great embassy and it’s recognized. Jerusalem is the capital of Israel. Sort of a great story.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:24:26"
"Donald Trump","And I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. We got it done in two hours and it’s not easy. And every president wanted to do those two things for many, many decades, but they couldn’t. And I understand why they couldn’t. A lot of pressure, a lot of pressure against. And instead of never ending wars in the Middle East, we’re forging peace deals all over the place. You see it. No blood in the sand, no blood in the sand. No cause. Biden and Obama made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. I stand with the proud people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom and we’re winning. We’re winning it. It’s going to be easy. We’re winning. The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama Biden Santos deal with Colombian drug cartels, surrendering to the Narco terrorists.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:25:24"
"Donald Trump","You know what that means? That means drugs. Our first lady sits on our commission. She chairs the commission of drugs and on drugs in America and how to get rid of it. It’s a blue ribbon commission, right. And we’re down 19%. We had a little setback with the recent problem with the China virus, but it’s getting back under control, but she’s taking it down 19. She and the commission have taken it down 19%. And she doesn’t want it mentioned. She doesn’t want to talk about it. She doesn’t want to talk about it. See if it would be sitting in her position, I’d be holding a news conference. I have done an incredible job. No, I’m only kidding. I’m only kidding. I’m only kidding. But she has done an incredible job. Thank you honey. Thank you. Thank you very much. Under my administration, we worked with Colombian officials to seize or disrupt 227 tons of poisonous narcotics since April alone. The fact is I’ve done more in 47 months than Sleepy Joe Biden has done in 47 years. It’s true.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:26:31"
"Donald Trump","It’s true. No administration in the first 3 and a half years has done what this administration has done. We’ve rebuilt our military. We’ve done the biggest tax cut in history, biggest regulation cut in history. What we’ve done is incredible, even environmentally. I’ll tell you what. We’re not going to go over a list, we’d be here all day, but no administration. And the fake news doesn’t even call me on it. Usually, if you make a statement, they think it’s 1% off. It’s a headline the next day. In the coming weeks, we will distribute a vaccine, defeat the virus, and complete the great American comeback. We’re in the process. A vote for Republicans like these people right down here is a vote for the great American dream. That’s what it is. I remember Abraham Lincoln, the great, the legendary Abraham Lincoln was a Republican. Would you please remember that? Nobody knows that. They know it now because I like to say it. Over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. We will defend religious liberty, free speech, and the right to keep and bear arms. Your 2nd Amendment will be defended. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. And I told you, we spent two and a half trillion with a T, trillion dollars, trillion on our military. We have to finest rockets, the finest missiles, the finest jets, F-35s. We have the finest tanks and submarines and ships all made in the USA. And our nuclear stockpile, we are in a position like no other country in the world. We are the envy of every country, Russia, China, North Korea. No country in the world has what we have. And just a lot of religious people in this audience, pray to God that we never have to use it. And it’s more likely that we won’t have to use it now that we have it, but just hope that we never have to use it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:27:49"
"Donald Trump","We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, lower drug prices even more, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions. America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. That’s already happening Nest. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto in God we trust. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now, you have a president who’s standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida. So get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors, get your boss. Pull them out of their chair. Come on, boss. And you got to get out and vote. There’s never been an election more important. On November 3rd, we must finish the job and drain the rest of the swamp. We’ve done a lot of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:30:20"
"Donald Trump","From Pensacola to Miami, from Orlando to Jacksonville, and from Tallahassee to right here in Tampa, we inherit the legacy of… You know it, right? We inherit the incredible legacy of Florida Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes who crossed the oceans, blazed the trails, settled the continent, tamed the wilderness, laid down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the great skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism. And from right here in this beautiful state, landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon. You’ve done a lot. We made America into the single greatest nation in the history of the world and the best is yet to come.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:31:50"
"Donald Trump","Proud citizens like you helped build this country and together we are taking back our country. We are returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion, and your drive, we are going to keep on working, we are going to keep on fighting, and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. We’re winning. We are winning again. We are winning again. We are one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God. And together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America powerful again. We have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Get out and vote. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-tampa-fl-october-29","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript Tampa, FL October 29","01:32:56"
