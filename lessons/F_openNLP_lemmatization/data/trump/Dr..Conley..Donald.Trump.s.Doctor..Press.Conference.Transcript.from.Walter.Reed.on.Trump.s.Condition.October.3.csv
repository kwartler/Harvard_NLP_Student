"Dr. Sean Conley","As reported yesterday, consultation with this group, I recommended we bring the President up to Walter Reed as a precautionary measure to provide state-of-the-art monitoring and any care that he may need. Just 72 hours into the diagnosis now, the first week of COVID, and in particular day seven to 10 are the most critical in determining the likely course of this illness.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-conley-donald-trumps-doctor-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-3","Dr. Conley (Donald Trump’s Doctor) Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 3","01:07"
"Dr. Sean Conley","At this time, the team and I are extremely happy with the progress the President has made. Thursday he had a mild cough, and some nasal congestion, and fatigue, all of which are now resolving and improving. At this time, I’d like to bring up Dr. Dooley to discuss some of the specifics of the President’s care.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-conley-donald-trumps-doctor-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-3","Dr. Conley (Donald Trump’s Doctor) Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 3","01:32"
"Dr. Dooley","Thank you, and good afternoon. I’m Dr. Sean Dooley, as Dr. Conley mentioned.

"Dr. Dooley","He’s receiving outstanding multidisciplinary care, the state of the science for coronavirus infection. We are monitoring him very closely for any evidence of complications from either the coronavirus illness or the therapies that we are prescribing to make him better.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-conley-donald-trumps-doctor-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-3","Dr. Conley (Donald Trump’s Doctor) Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 3","02:13"
"Dr. Dooley","We have monitored his cardiac function, his kidney function, his liver function, all of those are normal. And the President this morning is not on oxygen, not having difficulty breathing or walking around the White House Medical Unit upstairs. He’s in exceptionally good spirits. And in fact, as we were completing our multidisciplinary rounds this morning, the quote he left with was, “I feel like I could walk out of here today.” And that was a very encouraging comment from the President.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-conley-donald-trumps-doctor-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-3","Dr. Conley (Donald Trump’s Doctor) Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 3","02:34"

"Dr. Garibaldi","About 48 hours ago, the President received a special antibody therapy directed against the coronavirus, and we’re working very closely with the company to monitor him in terms of that outcome. Yesterday evening, he received his first dose of IV Remdesivir. And our plan is to continue a five day treatment course for Remdesivir. The big plan for today, since he’s in such great spirits and doing well, is to encourage him to eat, to drink, to stay hydrated, to be up out of bed, and to be working and doing the things that he needs to do to get well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-conley-donald-trumps-doctor-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-3","Dr. Conley (Donald Trump’s Doctor) Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 3","03:26"

"Dr. Sean Conley","It’s important to note the President’s been fever free for over 24 hours. We remain cautiously optimistic, but he’s doing great. With that… Oh, one other note, it should be clear that he’s got plenty of work to get done from the Chief of Staff. And he’s doing it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/dr-conley-donald-trumps-doctor-press-conference-transcript-from-walter-reed-on-trumps-condition-october-3","Dr. Conley (Donald Trump’s Doctor) Press Conference Transcript from Walter Reed on Trump’s Condition October 3","04:03"

"Dr. Sean Conley","Well, I don’t want to put a hard date on that. He’s doing so well, but with a known course of the illness, day seven to 10 we get really concerned about the inflammatory phase, phase two. Given that we provided some of these advanced therapies so early in the course, a little bit earlier than most of the patients we know and follow, it’s hard to tell where he is on that course. And so, every day we’re evaluating, does he need to be here? What does he need?
