"Donald Trump","So did anybody notice, I’m sure you didn’t, that we flew over, right over you, right? We have the greatest pilots and the greatest equipment anywhere in the world. I said, “I wonder if there’d be any danger.” “No, sir. Don’t worry.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","04:48"
"Donald Trump","And then, flying over I noticed something. I saw this crowd and then I saw a crowd bigger than this over there trying to get in. Can you believe it? Let them in. Let them in. Let them in. They’re coming in. Just let them in. I thought we could wait. Would you like to wait about an hour as they peel in? Do you have speakers back there, please? All right. You know the fake news they report this stuff, right? Right? No, they don’t. Sleepy Joe Biden yesterday had seven people and then they say he’s tied in the polls in Pennsylvania. I don’t know. There’s something going on here. There’s something phony going on. So you know the votes are coming in and they’re very much inclined to be with us. I don’t know if you see. You know, early voting, because our people like to go out and vote, right? They like to vote. They like to vote, and it’s incredible what’s happening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","05:07"
"Donald Trump","So the early votes are coming in, in a lot of areas, and they’re starting to get a little bit nervous on the other side. In Michigan, we’re leading the early vote. We’re supposed to be at 20% and then we catch them right in the final days like a race horse. No, no, no, it’s going to be very big. You don’t have events like this and you come in second in Arizona, okay? You don’t do that. I don’t say let’s leave now, goodbye you 25, 40,000, whatever the hell number of people. “Goodbye everybody. Oh, we’re in second place in Arizona.” I don’t think so.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","06:06"
"Donald Trump","No, we’re in first place in Arizona. But you know, these fake people back here, the press, the media, they’re fake, and same thing happened last time only worse. It was crazy. And last time, I never did it before so I believed them, and then what happened is we had the day and I was down in nine states that I had to win, right? I was down in all nine on Election Day and we won all nine, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","06:44"
"Donald Trump","They said, “This will be a very poor day for Donald Trump.” That time, Donald Trump, right? “This is going to be a rough day for Donald Trump down in nine states.” End of the evening you saw them cry. Remember? The guy, John King. “Oh my god. He just won Wisconsin. He just won Michigan. He just won Arizona. He just won Pennsylvania. What’s going on?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","07:16"
"Donald Trump","No, they were not having a good day. This is going to be even better I think. I mean, the only difference is a big risk is they sent out tens of millions of these unsolicited ballots and we’re trying to find out who did they send them to, when did they send them, where did they send them, who sends them back. Some of these governors say “You don’t need signature verification. Why would you need a thing like that?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","07:47"
"Donald Trump","No signature verification in some cases. “You don’t need a signature. Why would you need a thing like that?” They found 50,000 in a river. They found 53,000 in a creek. They found many in a garbage can that happened to be from the military. Many of them they were in a garbage can they found them, and they all had the name Trump on them. Isn’t that shocking? They were military all in favor of Trump and they found them in a garbage can.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","08:13"
"Donald Trump","I got to tell you that’s the only thing I’m concerned about, and we have law enforcement watching every one of them, and you have to watch them too. 15 days from now we’re going to win the state of Arizona and we’re going to win four more years in the White House. Everybody needs to get out and vote. Return your absentee ballot today or vote early in person as soon as you can. When does that start? Now? Now. Get out now, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","08:41"

"Donald Trump","And your state is doing great. You have a great governor as you know, and your state is doing great with the pandemic. Pandemic. They’re getting tired of the pandemic aren’t they? Getting tired of the pandemic. You turn on CNN. That’s all they cover. COVID, COVID, pandemic, COVID, COVID, COVID, COVID. You know why? They’re trying to talk everybody out of voting. People aren’t buying it CNN, you dumb bastards. They’re not buying it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","09:32"
"Donald Trump","That’s all they talk about. I watch this guy, he’s got lousy ratings. Fredo. You know Fredo? He’s got horrible ratings, and he’s talking about the pandemic. That’s all they talk about. You know? I don’t know. He said he had it. I’m not sure he had it. He went to the basement. It’s the only time his ratings were up. People want to see what was going to happen. He’ll probably get it again, even though in theory you’re not supposed to be able to. Well, I had it, and they say you’re not going to catch it again, and that’s okay with me. That’s okay with me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","10:01"
"Donald Trump","Oh, were they happy when they heard I had it, right? Did you see it? They were, “Well, we hope he gets better. We hope he gets better soon.” And then, I came out and I did a rally, and they said, “This guy hasn’t changed.” Actually, I don’t know if this is a compliment, they said, “He looks better now than before he had it.” What’s that all about? What’s that? Who knows?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","10:38"
"Donald Trump","If you have it you have it, and you get better. But we have great therapeutics. I took something, Regeneron, which we’re making available to everybody free, but to me it was a cure. Really, it wasn’t a therapeutic to me, it was a cure. I took it. I didn’t feel so great. I will tell you that. I don’t like to admit that in a long time, and I didn’t feel too great, and when you’re president you have a lot of doctors checking you out, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","11:00"
"Donald Trump","I told the story last night. By the way, these rallies, they’re unbelievable. And I like this better, remember, we’re outside. They all want us to be outside, you know? They’re all wanting us to be outside, and these are outdoor rallies, and we can hold more people than we can in the arenas. These are the biggest rallies. These are the biggest rallies every had in history by a political candidate. They won’t say that. No, it’s great. It’s great. But I took it and it was incredible. Incredible. And I was out, I took it, and I felt like Superman. The next morning I woke up, let me at them. With your vote we will continue to cut your taxes and regulations to maintain your energy independence, strengthen our military, support our great police, protect our Second Amendment, which is under siege, defend our borders, arrest violent criminals, and confirm more judges to uphold the rule of law.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","11:26"
"Donald Trump","We have a record number of judges. You see that. A record number of federal judges and we have a great one right now, hopefully gets approved next week, Amy. Under my leadership prosperity will surge, patriotism will soar, optimism will boom, the pandemic will soon end. It’s rounding the corner. They hate it when I say it. They always like to say about Europe, and this and that. Really? Oh really? How are they doing? How are they doing? I’ll tell you what.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","12:42"
"Donald Trump","And we’re working with them. We’re sending them ventilators, we’re sending them everything, but we’re rounding the turn. We’re going to have the vaccine, but with or without it, and it’s happening soon by the way, it would even happen sooner if we didn’t have these characters on the other side, the Democrats, that are running all these failed cities. The Democrats are running your failed cities. You know that, right? And states.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","13:12"
"Donald Trump","But they weren’t talking because they don’t want it to be successful. I really mean it. But ultimately, it’s going to all come together because it was coming together and then we got hit by the China plague. We were going to all be well-unified. People were calling me that you would’ve never expected. It was coming together because of success, and then we got hit by the plague. We closed up, which we did a great thing. We saved two million lives or more. Two million lives. We did a great job. We never got credit for it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","13:34"
"Donald Trump","We helped all of the states and the governors. Some did a good job, some did a horrible job. I’ll tell you who they are one day. Do I have the all-time great book? I have the real book. But like a lot of these other people I don’t like writing books while I’m running. I don’t like writing books while we’re in office because you don’t do that. Normal life will rapidly return. That’s what we want, normal. Go, take us back seven months. Normal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","14:06"
"Donald Trump","And next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country. That’s what’s going to happen. And we’re going to cut your taxes. This guy’s going to raise your taxes by four times. Think of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","14:33"
"Crowd","Boo.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","14:46"
"Donald Trump","And now, he’s saying, “Well, maybe I won’t take away the tax cuts,” because he said, “We’re going to end the Trump tax cuts.” They said, “Well, it’s going to ultimately be $8,000 a family.” He said, “Well, maybe we won’t end them. That doesn’t sound so good.” He’s gonzo folks. He’s gone. He has no idea, and the people that are running that party are radical far-left maniacs, and you can’t let this … This is the most important election in the history of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","14:47"
"Donald Trump","This is an election that’s a choice between a Trump recovery at the highest end, or a Biden depression. You’re going to have with what he’s going to do with regulations, what he’s going to do with taxes, every company that came in from Europe, from Asia, every company’s going to leave as soon as … I’ll tell you what, even the thought of it. As an example, FOXCONN. FOXCONN in Wisconsin, an incredible company, it makes a lot of the Apple equipment stuff, right? The phones, the iPhone, the iPads. Incredible company. They don’t like the Democrat governor. They don’t want to spend the money.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","15:17"
"Donald Trump","They would’ve come in and spent a lot of money. They don’t like the possibility that a Sleepy Joe could get in. They don’t want to invest billions of dollars and having those policies, so they pulled back. If Trump gets in they will spend billions, and billions, and billions. Not your state, but Wisconsin. Probably your state too. Billions of dollars. But we speak to them. They’re unhappy when they see this Democrat kind of leadership, or even the chance that it is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","15:52"
"Donald Trump","So wait till to see what FOXCONN does in Wisconsin. Okay? A different place, but wait till you see, if we win they will make an investment the likes of which our country has rarely seen before. But this is all a choice between getting a safe vaccine, or really a lot done. You know Biden wants to lock it down. He wants to listen to Dr. Fauci. He wants to listen to Dr. Fauci, and don’t forget Dr. Fauci what he said is, “No, no. Don’t close it to China.” I said, “I’m sorry, doctor. You’re a wonderful man,” and he is a nice man. “You’re a wonderful man. I’m closing it.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","16:17"
"Donald Trump","I saved thousands of lives. He admitted that two months later. Two months later. And Dr. Fauci said, “Don’t put on masks.” You see the thing. And now, he says put on masks, and they say he’s a wonderful guy, and he is a wonderful guy. I like him. He just happens to have a very bad arm. He has a bad arm, but he’s a good guy. He is a good guy. A lot of our people don’t like him. I like him. You have to understand him. He’s a promoter. What can he do? And it’s a choice between the American dream or a totally socialist nightmare. That’s what you’ll have. You’ll be a socialist country. And I said, “Our country will never be a socialist country. We’re not going to let it happen. It’ll be destroyed.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","16:51"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain. By the way, he’s made many corrupt bargains if you’ve been reading. You know he’s all shut down again. Can you believe it? He’s going lid. You know what lid means. Lid means a politician goes into I guess a garbage can or something. They put the lid on it, right? I guess. I don’t know. Maybe it’s something else. There’s an expression. They kept saying, “Sir, our vice president …” Pence is working his ass off I’ll tell you. He’s all over the place. He’s great. Did he do a good job against Kamala? If that were a fight they would’ve stopped it. No, Pence is great, but they put the lid on it to every day you wake up, where’s Biden today? “Sir, he’s lidded out.” He’s lidded out. What does that mean? That means he’s going to stay in the basement all day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","17:40"

"Donald Trump","I’ll tell you something, and I mean this too. He is lucky that we have in our country, and they don’t appreciate, a wonderful human being and the most fair attorney general of the United States, because I know people that would’ve had him locked up five weeks ago. Bill Barr is a very nice man, and a very fair man, and they have no idea because somebody else would’ve taken that thing and all the crap and corruption. He’s been a corrupt politician for a long time this guy, and in many ways it doesn’t make some of us happy, but in many ways Bill Barr is a wonderful human being and a very fair person, and he’s not a person that wants to hurt people. Just remember that. I say it and I say it once. Just remember it, because I get angry too, but just remember it. He’s a very fair man, and in many ways, and especially in that position there’s something very nice about it. Okay? So what can I say?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","18:54"

"Donald Trump","… in exchange for his party’s nomination, he has handed control of his whole group over to the socialists, the communists, the Marxists, and the left wing extremists. You know that. You see them marching up the streets in these Democrat run cities, you don’t see them in the Republican run cities. They’re in charge and they are calling the shots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","20:03"
"Donald Trump","If elected, Biden will delay the therapies. Look, I mean, even the vaccines, they’re trying to say, “Oh, it’s no good. If Trump passes it.” It’s being done by Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer. I don’t even know who these people are. Right? “If it comes out with Trump …” How bad is that? They are willing to demean a vaccine for political purposes.

"Donald Trump","No, no. I saw it this morning where a governor who’s done a truly poor … thousands. Tens of thousands of people have died in his state, Andrew Cuomo, he’s done a terrible job. 11,000 people died in a nursing home, he could have put them in the convention center that I built. We opened up 2,800 beds. We moved the big hospital ship. It was empty. He could’ve put them there. He put them back in, infected people back in with our elderly population, knowing that our elderly population is susceptible. Andrew Cuomo, he killed thousands and thousands of people.

Fredo?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","20:45"
"Donald Trump","No, it’s a shame. It’s just a shame, but I saw him. He was knocking the vaccine, “If the vaccine comes out during the Trump administration, we’re not going to use it.” It’s nothing to do with me. It’s Johnson & Johnson, it’s Pfizer, it’s Moderna. These are the greatest companies in the world. It has nothing to do with me. We need a vaccine and when it’s ready, it should come out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","21:28"
"Donald Trump","Already, in my opinion, except for politics, they just don’t want it to come out before the election. But you know what? I’m the one that did it. This thing wouldn’t be here for two years and they’re ready to come. But it’s a shame. It’s a shame when you try and demean something so important for politics, it’s a shame. But they’d like to postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, shut down your country. We’re not doing it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","21:52"

"Donald Trump","He’ll massively raise your taxes, Biden. He’s going to raise your taxes. First time I’ve ever heard of a politician. He’s running on raising taxes. That’s how crazy the world has become. All my life I see politicians, they want to cut your taxes, “We’re going to cut your taxes.” The other guy says, “We’re going to cut it more.” Well, this is an easy one for me then, because we cut them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","22:51"
"Donald Trump","We gave you the greatest, biggest tax cut in history, and he’s going to give you the biggest tax cut in reverse because what he’s going, he’s going to end ours, but he’s going to give you the biggest tax increase in the history of our country. Now think of it, think of it, who the hell can win with that platform? If you listen to these people, “This election is tied.” We’re three points up in your state. But I don’t know. I think how can you be three points up when we have crowds like this and nobody shows up. Three points? Three points?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","23:12"
"Donald Trump","No. So we’re cutting your taxes, he’s increasing your taxes. Just those two things. Isn’t that sort of the end of the election? Now we can make the case, something’s good. It will destroy your 401(k)s, it will destroy the stock market, which is ready to reach new historic … Can you imagine rounding the turn or the pandemic, and we have the highest stock market we’ve ever had? Think of this. Some of our numbers are higher than they were, housing and different things. Some of our numbers are higher than they were even before the pandemic.

"Donald Trump","You know why? Because we built such a strong foundation. If we didn’t have that strong foundation, this would be a disaster. He wants to bury you in regulations, outsource your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders. He doesn’t want borders. The wall, by the way, is almost finished. You have the strongest Southern border you’ve ever had. He wants to confiscate your guns, get rid of your second amendment. He wants to ban American energy, no fracking.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","24:27"
"Donald Trump","How about that? For a year and a half, he says, “No fracking.” Then he goes to Pennsylvania, we have a million jobs, the state is dependent on it, and all of a sudden he says, “Oh, well, I guess we can frack,” and the press doesn’t call him because they are more corrupt than Biden himself. They want to wipe out your private health care plans. A lot of people, 180 million people, have private healthcare and they love it. They’re so happy, and it’s all going to disappear. You will be able to go to your local hospital ward and stand in line for six weeks when you have a cold or when you have something worse, this is what’s going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","25:01"

So women of the suburbs, look, here’s the story, women of the suburbs, the fake news has been saying, “The women of the …” They said this last time too, “Women don’t like Trump.” Then they saw … Then they saw 52% voted for Trump, right?

Where they destroy these incredible communities. Ben said, “Well, we can really bring it down and make it much more palatable.” I said, “No, Ben, you know what?

As far as the eye can see it’s people. Unbelievable. Unbelievable. They never do it. They never turn the camera. I used to think they couldn’t, physically, it was stuck. They couldn’t do it, but they can because whenever there’s a little problem, that thing goes like a pretzel. It’s unbelievable. But they never want to show these crowds. They never want to do it, because they’re fake. Listen, we have a Congressman, who’s a friend of mine, who’s a warrior, Paul Gosar. Where’s Paul? Where’s Paul? Thank you, Paul. A warrior, a warrior and a friend of ours, who’s incredible. She’s leading, from what I’m hearing Tiffany, I hear she’s leading. Congressional Candidate, Tiffany Shedd. Tiffany. You’re leading in the poll.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","53:57"
"Donald Trump","Wow. That’s a long way. She’s incredible. What a great career, and that you’re doing this, is so great. Thank you, Tiffany. Tiffany Shedd. Get out and vote for her, and a friend of mine, somebody that was great. She would have been, if she didn’t have three, four people running at the same time, she would have been your Senator. I hate to say it. She would been your Senator, a friend that’s a so loyal and strong, but, and a good person. Arizona GOP Chair, Kelly Ward. She’s worked so hard. She is some warrior and fighter and just … They don’t even understand it. Okay? I don’t even understand you sometimes, Kelly. You don’t, she doesn’t give up. How are we doing Kelly?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","55:03"

Jimmy? Where’s Jimmy? Jimmy, thank you for everything, Jimmy. Thank you for everything. I was recently honored to receive the coalition’s endorsement and I want to thank you. You’re really amazing. Thank you, Jimmy. A tough guy and a good guy. In addition, I was just named, I have to say this, Man of The Year by law enforcement’s big magazine. It’s called Blue Magazine. Man of the year. I love law enforcement. We’re delighted to be joined by a legendary quarterback. I used to watch this guy. He’d win with the brain as well as the body.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","55:53"
"Donald Trump","Jim McMahon, two-time, All-American at Brigham Young and later a two-time Super Bowl champion. Where’s Jim? Where is he? I love that guy. Look at him. Look at that guy. Look at that guy. I’ll tell you. I loved your coach too. I loved Mike Ditka and I love Singletary. Singletary likes Trump. You know that, right? You think Singletary’s tough enough? Was he tough enough? Look at him. He’s all business. He’s taken those pictures. That’s him. Jim, you were a winner, man, and you are a winner. I made it too and say hello to Ditka and say hello to Singletary and all those guys. What a great team, right? That was a team of champions. You win with a muscle, but you got to win with this too. You got to win with this too.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","56:47"
"Donald Trump","We just gave out a presidential medal to a great fighter. Dan. Does everybody know our Dan right out of Iowa. How about Jim Jordan? Is he a great one? Jim Jordan, right? He was a great wrestler, where you had so many. We have so many people that are behind us. Anyway, great to be with you, Jim. Thank you very much for coming. We appreciate it. Dan Gable, everybody. You know, Dan Gable? Did you ever hear of Dan Gable? Hey Jim. He was 182 wins and one loss. He won everything, and he was an unbelievable coach at Iowa. Dan Gable.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","57:37"
"Donald Trump","Then think of it, a career 182 and one. In fact, I asked who was the one. I guess he was pretty good, but he ended up beating him in the Olympics. Then he went to the Olympics and he won the Olympic gold medal. Dan Gable, any wrestling person would know. In Iowa, Dan Gable is a legend and he is all over the country and in the wrestling world, the greatest ever. He goes to the Olympics and he never lost a point. In the final, he had to wrestle the Russian, who was supposed to be unbeatable, but he was supposed to be unbeatable too. He beat the Russian and never allowed a point. He went through the entire schedule and never allowed one point. Think about that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","58:15"
"Donald Trump","He won the Olympic Gold Medal and Dan Gable is now getting the Presidential Medal of Freedom. He’s coming to the White House. That’s pretty cool. Thank you, Jim. Under my administration, we built the greatest economy of the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. It’s make America great again, right? Now I go, “Make America great again, again. Make it great again, again.” That’s what we’re doing. We’re way ahead of schedule. In my first three years, we increased family income by over $6,000, more than five times … Think of this. Five times the gain. We were actually more than that. More than five times the gain, in all eight years under the last administration. Five times a gain, in a much shorter period of time. African-American unemployment, and Hispanic-American unemployment, and Asian-American unemployment. Think of that. We all reached the lowest levels in the history of our country. African-American, Asian- American, Hispanic-American. We lifted 6-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","58:56"
"Donald Trump","… Asian American, Hispanic American. We lifted 6.6 million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans who are liking Trump a lot. I like you too. I don’t know if you see what’s happening with Hispanic Americans. We are leading them in the polls. It’s never happened before. I’ve always liked Hispanics, and they like me. This was not supposed to be happening, but I love the Hispanic Americans, and they’re doing great. By the way, they’re great business people. Our policies are lifting up all Americans of every income.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:00:03"
"Donald Trump","Since the China virus, we’ve created a record 11.4 million American jobs. Think of that. They just announced, think of this, it sounds terrible in one way, but you were hearing numbers like 42% unemployment. It’s not everybody’s fault, except China. It came in, and you were hearing it could be 42, 38, whatever. They just announced it, 7.8% unemployment. We’re going to be back to where we were very soon unless you put a fool into office who’s going to raise your taxes and put back all the regulations where every company is going to leave. No, think of it, doesn’t 7.8 at one point … I don’t like to say it because we were down to 3.4, 3.5, but 7.8, if you would’ve heard that three, four, five months ago you would have said impossible. We’ll be back to the same number, and next year we’ll be stronger than ever before. You watch.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:00:39"
"Donald Trump","After the virus left China, we experienced the smallest contraction of any major Western country and the fastest recovery by far of any country. Think of that. As president, I’ve been delivering for the incredible Hispanic American community like never before. I’m fighting for school choice, for safe neighborhoods, for Hispanic-owned small businesses. I have a couple of them. Some were my friends with the restaurant. Oh, they’re doing so well. They’ve made a lot of money my restaurant. Couple of people didn’t like that restaurant. I liked it, and now they have lines around the block.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:01:34"
"Donald Trump","Joe Biden would obliterate everything Hispanic Americans have worked for, wiping out your small businesses with lockdowns and regulations, and devastating your families with massive tax hikes. He wants to give you the big, big fat tax hikes. He will wage war on Catholic organizations, ban charter schools, bankrupt Catholic schools. We’ve already taken care of the funding for Catholic schools. Fund extreme late-term abortion, and let socialists run wild in our country. That’s why we’re going to win a record share of the Hispanic vote. There will never be a share of the Hispanic vote like this, unless we decide to run again in four years, and then another run [inaudible 01:02:56]. We invested $2.5 trillion in the U.S. military. We have the best equipment of any country in the world. We’ve upgraded our nuclear to a level that it’s never even been close to. We have new rockets, and missiles, and ships, and tanks. What we have is incredible. The F-35 fighter jet, the best in the world still, tankers, new tankers, new freighters. We have everything. $2.5 trillion all made in the USA. We are the envy of Russia. We are the envy of China. Nobody has the equipment. Even the hydrosonic missiles that Obama messed up on. We have hydrosonic missiles that go seven times faster than a normal missile. We have the best hydrosonic in the world. You know, they stole our plans during the Obama administration. Another thing that happened. These are little things that happened that I won’t tell anybody. Okay?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:02:12"
"Donald Trump","We also passed for our veterans VA Choice and VA Accountability. Everyone said that would have been impossible. Last year American warriors killed the founder and leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi. We killed al-Baghdadi, and we have a very special person with us today. Just days ago, my administration brought two depraved ISIS terrorists known as the Beatles from the United Kingdom. These were two bad ones. These are people I would have liked to give to Jim and his team to work over. Jim would have liked that I think. Jim would have been very happy. To stand trial for killing four American hostages, Peter Kassig, Steven Sotloff, James Foley, and Kayla Mueller.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:03:57"

Her family as you know, her mother and father came and they spoke beautifully at the Republican National Convention. But we’re deeply moved to be joined by her incredible and loving family, her dad Carl, her mom Marsha, and the entire family. We will hold Kayla’s precious memory in our hearts forever.

"Donald Trump","You look younger since I last saw you. You know? Look at you. You look very good. I want to thank you very much. What an incredible story. You said, if we were here earlier instead of Obama, she would have been with us today. She would have been with us today, and that’s true. That’s true. They could have done that. They didn’t do it. They just talk. They talk all the time. They don’t do it. I want to thank you very much. Incredible. Her memory will never, ever be forgotten. Right? What a story it is. What a vicious story. What a horrible story. But he’s dead. We also took out … They’d been looking for him for many years. He was the founder of ISIS and he was rebuilding it because we obliterated the ISIS, 100% of the ISIS caliphate.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:05:42"
"Donald Trump","He was looking to build it again, and we got him. You know, the guys that got him, a story that not a lot of people know. I think it was Kayla’s birth date. Right? They used the birth date as the number, and they talked that number, that specific number. That was their code name for taking out this horrible al-Baghdadi. Right? Great honor. They don’t do that often. They don’t do that often. But they used her birth date, and then they took him out. They didn’t play games, and a dog on that one became more famous than I did, and that’s good. That dog was a hell of a dog, and still is. We also took out the mass murderer of American troops, and a lot of other people, and a lot of other troops. Soleimani is dead. Soleimani, another one.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:06:29"
"Donald Trump","I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal. I recognized the true capital of Israel, and opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem. Every president talked about that for decades and decades, and then they got to be president and they never did a damn thing about it. I did it. I got it done. I even got it built for a tiny fraction of the cost. You know that story. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. For 52 years they were talking. I got it done in about two hours. Instead of endless war in the Middle East, we’re forging peace in the Middle East. Nations are joining, one after another. The fact is, I did more in 47 months than sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years, except what he did for himself. A vote for Republican is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. This is such an important state. If we win this state, we win it all. This is such an important state, and I happen to love this state. So in conclusion, over the next four years we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world, and we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s already started. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:07:17"

We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of endless foreign wars. They’re coming home. They’re all coming home. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. That’s what we have. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency, which is even more important you will find than healthcare, and it’s already signed. I did it. It goes into effect on January 1st. I said, “Couldn’t you have made it like a little back further?” They said, “Statutorily, sir,” but it’s already signed and done.

America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’s happening quickly. We now again with NASA have by far the preeminent space center anywhere in the world. Not even close. It was closed. It was dead. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, honor our history, and always respect our great American flag.

From Phoenix to Flagstaff, from Tombstone to Prescott, from Mesa to Yuma, to Red Rock and Sedona, and all over the place. This is so beautiful. How good is this place? Huh?

Close enough. He’s flustered. He’s so tough. Arizona’s where Wyatt Earp and Doc Holiday became American legends. Wyatt Earp, right, that’s a good one. That’s a good one to have. It’s where the great American West became the American dream, and Arizona’s the state where generations of pioneers and prospectors, and miners and ranchers, cowboys and cattle hands, marshals and lawmen, tamed the frontier, braved the blazing sun like I’m doing right now.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-prescott-arizona-october-19","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Prescott, Arizona October 19","01:11:44"
