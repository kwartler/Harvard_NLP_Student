We’re building a lot of them. Well, hello, Michigan. Great to be with you. Great. Special place. It’s great to be back in this incredible state with thousands of loyal, hardworking American Patriots.

"Donald Trump","I’d like to speak with you today about one of the most vital issues in this race. You know what it is? It’s the radical left’s plan to erase American history, purge American values, and destroy the American way of life, and that’s what they’re trying to do. You see it every day. That’s what they’re trying to do. We’re not going to let that happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:01"
"Donald Trump","This election will decide whether we preserve our magnificent heritage or whether we allow far left radicals to wipe it all away. That’s not going to happen. Joe Biden, sleepy Joe, has made a corrupt bargain in exchange for his party’s nomination. He has handed control of his party over to the hardcore militant left. You know that. You see that every day. The Democrat party you once knew, just no longer it exists, right? This is not the same party. These people are crazy. It’s now the party of socialists, Marxists and left wing extremists. If Biden wins, the lawless demonstrators in our streets, that are around Democrat run cities and state, not Republican run. These are Democrat run and we want to go in and we want to help them. And largely they don’t want to be helped. It’s an incredible thing, but they’re all over our streets and these areas will be ended. We want to end it. We want to end it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:25"

We went in and boy did that take about what, 30 minutes to solve that problem? And that’s why we’re going to win Minnesota. Hasn’t been won since 1972 by a Republican. We’re going to win Minnesota. Of course, having people like Omar doesn’t hurt either. Omar, Ilhan Omar. She doesn’t love our country too much. I don’t think so. They crave power and God help us if they ever did get it. God help us. I can tell you that. You just have to look all over the world at different places.

"Donald Trump","This election day, the people of Michigan must stop these anti-American radicals by issuing Joe Biden and his group a thundering defeat at the ballot box. And by the way, it seems to be happening. Seems to be happening. Seems to be happening. I don’t want to speak too early, but you know, there’s a big story out right now. Do you know that? Do you know about it, right? You know, we’re supposed to be way behind you until election day when all the Republicans go and you’re going to have a red wave like you’ve never seen before. And even the fake news media saying that we’re going to have a wave.

But there’s a lot of concern going on out there. This sounds like a little bit like four years ago, but this should be much bigger because we’ve done everything we said and more. We’ve done it all.

"Donald Trump","Do you remember 12 years ago or so I got Man of the Year in Michigan. I said, “Well, that’s nice.” I came to Michigan and I made this speech like why are you allowing them to take your automobile business, your car making business? Why are you allowing them to take it to Mexico and Canada and every place else? Why are you allowing? I made this big deal. I actually got blasted for it. They named me Man of the Year and I’m complaining, right? But no, it’s probably why I’m here. It’s probably the number one thing what they were doing to us [inaudible 00:05:07]. But now Michigan has many, many factories. You didn’t have a factory built for 40 years. Now you have many factories being built, already built. And a lot of them being expanded.

You know, a lot of crazy policies, but you got to get us.” And he said, “Well, this is a thing for companies.” I said, “You have great power.” He said, “Well, the government doesn’t get involved.” “You got to do it.” And he said, “Well, we will look into it.” Next day, they announced five factories coming in. [inaudible 00:05:57] And he was a great Prime Minister and a great guy and he’s a friend of ours. And he was forced. He had a medical difficulty, but I’ll tell you what, what a fabulous guy.

And we like Ronald Reagan. We like a lot of people. Nobody’s ever heard that phrase before. You know why? Because first of all, we’ve made tremendous progress. We’ve rebuilt our military.

The point of cancel culture is not to convince you, it’s to humiliate you, and break you, and control you. But the American people will never submit, we will never apologize, and we will not be controlled, and never be broken. No, nobody’s seen anything what’s going on.

And I just brought this out because they had things. You wouldn’t even believe this. They falsely and constantly smear America as a sinister and racist country that must be torn apart piece by piece.

We laugh and we smile and everyone thinks it’s… When this first started happening with statues of people that most of us, almost all of us, never heard of. I said, “Be careful because they’ll go after Jefferson, Washington. They’ll go after Lincoln.” And that was three years ago. Now, a friend of mine came to me the other day. He said, “You know, you said this was going to happen.” I said, “I did?” He said, “Yeah, you did. You said all of a sudden it’ll keep going up.” They took out Robert E. Lee.

You know, I had to go back to work on this stuff. I didn’t have to come to Michigan. I said, “Look, we’re building all these plants.” You got the best of year.

But we are rebuilding and we’re doing things that you wouldn’t believe. But this cancel culture. So when we started, and I had to start all over, and we had to do things a lot different. We became a lot different country for a period of time because we had this horrible plague that came from China.

And the governor is fantastic. You know Kristi, right? Fantastic. And the people are fantastic and they’re so proud of it. And then I read where they want to blow up Mount Rushmore before I got there. I mean, they want to blow it up. We want to blow the face off Mount Rushmore. I don’t think that’s happening.

Sleepy Joe said nothing when statues of Christopher Columbus, think of that, Christopher Columbus. They want to blow up all the statues. Now he just blew the Italian vote, by the way. So I don’t know. Anybody who’s Italian here, by any chance? If you’re Italian, do you happen to like Christopher Columbus? Christopher? Christopher Columbus. No. Think of it. You’re Italian. They want to blow up. You know, we had it. I think it was in New York. So they were going to rip down this gorgeous, right in New York, right? And the Italian circled that they saw. That was the end of those people. They just sort of went away. You know, they’re sitting there and standing there and they had various things that they were holding.

They like to blame everything on the right. This is the left. They like to blame everything on the right. But the Antifa people, okay? So they wanted to do it. But when they saw this group of people, they said, “You know what? Let’s take a pass. Let’s go someplace else and rip down a statue.” But now they’re not doing it too much because I signed into law, I signed a bill that gives you 10 years in jail if you rip down any federal statue.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","20:06"

Right? The ragtags. Remember? He came in with the British. They came in their beautiful uniforms. He had the ragtags. The battle lasted about a half hour. Right? They want to take that statue of Andrew Jackson down right away. Thomas Jefferson, that’s a tough one to take down. Right? Thomas Jefferson. They want to take down the Jefferson Memorial. Anybody see the Jefferson? I don’t think we’re moving. I’ll tell you what. If I wasn’t your President, last summer, you may have the Jefferson Memorial taken. Now it may be down.

Then they found out there’s like 5,000 places. No, we’ll keep the name George Washington if you don’t mind. If the if the media would perhaps put it correctly, a lot of people back there.

They even want to erase the names of Democrat senators, and Republican senators, current and past. They want to erase the name of Clinton, yeah, hey, well hey, that’ll be next. That’s a good one. Crooked Hillary will take her name, does she have her name on anything? I don’t know if she’s got her name on anything, right? I don’t know.

"Donald Trump","Are we having a good time? Is there ever a better place to be than a Trump rally? In general though, we don’t call it a rally, because you’re not allowed to have rally because you can’t meet more than two people. They had a number of states, and they had it so that… It was all against me. I think Minnesota. But a lot of them, where you can’t have a rally. And it said, you cannot have groups larger than three people, you cannot have anything to do with politics. You can’t do this, you can’t do that, you can’t do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","27:17"

"Donald Trump","I said, “Well wait a minute, so I’m not precluded from ever going to that state and talking to the people?” Which is really bad. They said, “No, you can’t do it.” I said, “Well, is there any exclusion?” “Yes, only protests.” Right? Exclusion is a protest. And they didn’t even use the word peaceful. I do, because I like to make it sound a little… The only thing you could do, is you could protest, you could riot in the streets of Minneapolis, burn down their stores. You could beat the hell out of people. You could do whatever you want. So I said, “I have an idea. Let’s call all our rallies, which we do, peaceful protests.” And now we have legal problem.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","27:52"
"Donald Trump","Because, if we call this a rally, we’d have a problem. So we call it a peaceful protest. So officially, if anyone asks you, like the fake news when you’re walking out, just say, “No, no, this was a peaceful protest, thank you very much.” If you’re a moderate Democrat or Liberal who knows that your party has gone totally off the rails, you have a moral duty to immediately stop this lunacy. You must, by law, join the Republican party. We welcome you to the Republican party, and the party of Abraham Lincoln, you know I can say that. A lot of people don’t know that.

To ensure that our nation honors the memory of American patriots, I’m establishing a beautiful vast… It’s going to be chosen in the very near future, we have many sites. A vast outdoor park that will feature the statues of all of the greatest Americans who have ever lived.

"Donald Trump","Now you know me from private life. So I’m thinking about calling it the Trump National Garden of American Heroes. Somebody said, “Why didn’t you go with the Trump name?” I said, “No, I don’t think I’ll get away with that one.” To combat the toxic left wing propaganda in our schools I recently announced that we’re launching a new pro-American lesson plan for students called the 1776 Commission. We will teach our children the greatness and glory of America, if they don’t know it. But they’re not being taught that, they’re being taught that we’re not great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","31:29"
"Donald Trump","I’ve also issued an executive order to prohibit the teaching of critical race theory in the federal government. Critical race theory is a Marxist doctrine, oh you’re so lucky I’m your president, because that was getting out of… No, no. This was getting out of hand. This was getting out of hand. This was getting in the military. This was going all over the place. This was getting out of hand. Critical race theory is a Marxist doctrine that rejects the vision of Martin Luther King Jr, and all of our great forefathers, and instead forces people to judge each other based on race, skin color, and other things that we’re not supposed to be thinking about, we’re not supposed to be, in any way, shape or form, thinking about.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","32:09"

Defense companies, a lot of big companies.” And I said, “So what’s going on?” “Well they’re teaching it there to.” So I signed another one, just two weeks ago, saying that if you do that you cannot do business with the United States of America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","33:29"

Is it still… Because I’m just wondering. Maybe it’s just an aberration. It’s early, it’s only been a few days, right? But maybe it’s… That’s a big thing, to me, that’s a big thing. That’s like a poll, and that’s hundreds of thousands of votes, that’s like a poll. You ever see these polls? We have interviewed 83 people. No, it’s amazing. They’re not likely to vote. You’re supposed to interview likely to vote. So they’re not likely. They’re registered. You know what a registered voter is? People that have died 14 years ago are registered, they’re registered to vote, you got plenty of them in Los Angeles. They have many people. They were over 100 years old. Every one of them voted for years.

The following day she called up, “You have to come back one more time.” So anyway, so I did. And I went to Grand Rapids, right? And we had 32,000 people. And you know what?

He said, “You don’t want to run against Trump.” And it was, I viewed that as a compliment. They all smiled, they thought it was wonderful. But he said something very interesting. He said, “You better watch Michigan.” Because he was here. He said, “I saw a Trump Pence sign on every lawn.” And he also said, he also said, “You better watch Wisconsin, and you better watch Minnesota.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","41:48"

"Donald Trump","A guy like Biden and the Democrats want to keep Michigan locked up, locked down, and closed for business. No, it’s so badly hurting you stay. And then I guess they said she was threatened. Right? And she blamed me. She blamed me and our people were the ones that worked with her people. So let’s see what happens. Let’s see what happens. But I have to tell you something, our FBI has to start looking at Antifa and they have to start looking at some people that they’re not looking at like they should be.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","46:46"
"Donald Trump","Biden will shut down the country, delay the vaccine, and prolong the pandemic and its time. But you know, we won another great case in Michigan, right? It was ruled unconstitutional what she was doing to you. You know, we have the task force, we’ve done a great job. We got to everything. We filled up your cupboard as the expression goes, especially with the ventilators and all stuff that could never have happened.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","47:39"
"Donald Trump","And we have these calls with governors. Mike Pence heads up the taskforce. He did a great job. We have great professionals and we took this thing and we have all the governors, usually 50 governors on the line at one time, and they’re always, “Sir, you’ve a great job. Thank you very much. Great job. Great job. Great job.” Your governor’s down. I mean it’s all down. “Thank you very much. You’ve done a great job on behalf of Michigan. I’d like to thank you, ba, ba, ba.” Then she goes out, speaks to the press, ” We’re very unhappy with the president.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","48:04"
"Donald Trump","You know, being a real estate developer was much nicer, the people. I used to say, “If you can make it in the world of New York real estate, they’re the toughest people.” Now I call these guys that are friends of mine. Some I can’t stand, but some I like. I say, “You guys are babies compared to what I go through with these maniacs. You’re babies.” No, but it’s true. But she’s saying, “Thank you very much. It’s great. We have everything we need. He gave us 400 trillion goggles. You gave us this. You gave us that. You gave us more anything.” We built hospitals, right? We built hospitals. We did everything.

"Donald Trump","The Army Corps of Engineers and FEMA, the job they’ve done is incredible. And she, and others in all fairness, everybody, they’re all very happy. They are all, every single one, even the real haters, they were happy. And they would say happy. But in her case, and in some others, they would then go on and some were legit.

"Donald Trump","But she would go out and say, “Great, very happy.” I said, “Is there anything else you want, Governor?” “No, we have everything. Thank you very much. We really appreciate it on behalf of Michigan. Very good.” And then she’d go out and bad mouth me. I mean, it’s incredible. It’s so dishonest. Right? It’s so dishonest.

"Donald Trump","By the way, and be careful of her and her attorney general, because you know they’re like a judge of the ballot stuff, right? So how the hell do I put my political and our country’s political life in the hands of a pure partisan like that, right? So you got to watch it, watch those ballots, watch what’s going on.

They had another group of ballots. They were printed and they forgot two words. Donald Trump. They forgot to put them. Oh, that’s okay. You know, they figured that’s okay.

Then they say, “If you lose, will you have a friendly transition?” I say, “I want a fair election.” Then they say, ” Will you have a fair… We want a fair and friendly transition.” I said, “Really? Well, when I won, you spied on my campaign, we caught you trying to overthrow the President of the United States. You’re crooked as hell. And we caught you and let’s see what happens to them. But you’re crooked as hell. And to me, that didn’t exactly look like a friendly transition.

"Donald Trump","So anyway. So we’re… The best way, if we could really win this decisively, it would be fabulous. Just decisively. It’s a knockout punch and you know what? We’ll all get back together. Somebody said, “How do you bring the country together?” I said, “It was happening before the China virus came in.” It’s true. I was starting getting in calls from people, the most unlikely people, Democrats, very radical left Democrats. And all of a sudden we had the best employment numbers we ever had. We had 160 million people working. It’s called make America great again. Now I say, “Make America great again, again.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","51:32"
"Donald Trump","It’s make America great again, again. We’ll have to change those hats. But we had it and people were calling and I’m telling you the country was coming together. And then we had the China virus float in, but this country was coming together because there’s nothing like success. And success was bringing it together and people ask me, “Can it ever get together?” And some people here will be surprised when I say the answer is yes. Success is going to bring us together.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","52:12"
"Donald Trump","And I’m telling you, we were there. We had just signed the deal with China. We had just made the USMCA, Mexico, Canada, great trade deal. Got rid of NAFTA, the worst trade deal ever made. But we were there and calls were being made. And then we got hit with the pandemic with the rest of the world. And China kept it out of the rest of China, but they didn’t keep it out of the world. So we can never forget that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","52:43"
"Donald Trump","But I’ll tell you what, what keeps us, what will bring us all together is success. It’s going to happen, too. It’s going to happen. Our congressman will be having lunch soon, someday with a radical left, maybe AOC. Do you see yourself? Maybe not. He’s going, “I don’t know about that.” That might be a step too far, right? Omar, he’ll be having lunch with Ilhan Omar who truly hates our country. But she’s one of the reasons we’re going to win the great state of. We’re going to win. We’re going to win because of Ilhan, right? We’re going to win Minnesota because of her. You don’t see having lunch with Ilhan? He refuses. He said, “I don’t care how well we do.

"Donald Trump","I’m delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery. And you see what we’ve done with the vaccines and the therapeutic and the cures. Hey, I’m here. Me. I’m here, right? No, we had great doctors. Walter Reed Medical Center, incredible doctors, Johns Hopkins. One thing when you’re president, they have a lot of doctors. I’m laying in bed, I’m not feeling too great. And I’m looking up and I’m seeing doctors, I just get, please leave me alone. And each one wanted to touch a different part of my body. And I didn’t like that. I said, “Get the hell out of here, doctors.” But we had a drug, brand new, it’s Regeneron and some others make something, several antibodies. And all I know is I went from not feeling too great. Now, who knows. It might’ve been good, it might’ve been… The young people have no problem. And I made the mistake of saying in front of CNN and some of the fakers back there, I said, ” Well, I’ll have no trouble because I’m young. I’m an extraordinary shape. I’m a very great physical.” And, and CNN said, “He lied to the American public. He said he was young.

"Donald Trump","They can’t take a joke, can they? They can’t take a joke. No, but they made it into a big deal. They always do, you know that? You can’t do anything. I said with the illegal aliens that come in, Biden said, “We’ll give him all Medicare. We’ll give them healthcare. We’ll give him education.” No, what it does is it brings them in. So I said that the Democrats want to give them healthcare, free college education.

And the giant tech companies, and they’re putting themselves in danger, Section 230, they are putting themselves. Because they’re only existing because the government gave them something that they’ve never given anybody else. And they don’t want it.

"Donald Trump","No, it’s the most unbelievable thing what’s going on. And he’s a criminal. He’s committed crimes. For the last 47 years, Biden’s shifted away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders, ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in these ridiculous, endless foreign wars. They’re all coming home, by the way. In 2016, Michigan voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president to finally put America first, right?

"Donald Trump","We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden and his group inflicted upon us over the last 47 years. He was a cheerleader for NAFTA. Worst trade deal ever made.

The Paris Environmental Accord.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","57:27"

Nobody else would have done it. When I said, “Oh man, I’m breaking this Paris. I’m getting out of that thing.” That was a disaster. They basically wanted to take our wealth. You can’t use what’s underground. And we have it in other countries down. It was really a terrible thing. And it’s funny. I got out, I terminated it. Got out and the people got it. They praised it.

"Donald Trump","Half of all auto manufacturing jobs in Michigan were lost after Biden backed NAFTA and the China disasters, right? World trade. That’s when China became strong, the world trade. One of the great ripoffs of all time. Biden should be asking Michigan workers for your votes. He’s asking you for your votes. You know what he should be asking? He should be asking for your forgiveness. You should forgive them. I would say forgive him. Because even then he had no idea what the hell he was doing.

This country, we have spirit. And that’s why I’m not so surprised to hear what’s happening. In North Carolina, they say certain areas that are inclined with maybe our thinking like you have to go out and work and love your life and get your kids in school and all of those things. They say the lines are two miles long. They’ve never seen anything like it. The spirit in our country is incredible and that’s happening. That’s going to be happening in Pennsylvania, you watch.

Didn’t produce anything for us, but it gave them 250,000. So we renegotiated it.

Look at all the empty buildings you had all over from New England to here, all over the place. What a horrible deal that was. The USMCA is expected to create a minimum of 76,000 new automotive… The auto fixers, the automobile jobs, automotive jobs. You have so many of them and they’re all coming.

Then all of a sudden you had a second row and a third row and a fourth. And they had their tear gas and they had their pepper spray, which the other side doesn’t want to use because it’s not nice. They can throw cans at you and they can throw rocks and stones and hurt your police, but you’re not allowed to guard yourself with tear gas, pepper spray, which 100% are effective. So they just marched forward. And the whole thing was over. It was like… it was over.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:10:50"
"Donald Trump","I don’t know, there’s something about that, when you’re watching everybody getting pushed around. There’s something very beautiful about it. I don’t care what anyone says. Not politically correct. I’ll be on, they’ll say, “He thinks that that was beautiful.” But you people get it. You get it probably better than I do even, right, when you get right down to it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:11:36"
"Donald Trump","But what they’re doing will not only undermine your security, but it will overcrowd your hospitals and divert needed resources for low-income communities that we’re all for. We want to help people. We want to help our citizens. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in US history. And when the wall is finished, which will be very soon, we are going to have a great, big, beautiful celebration. And with that wall, by the way, we’re keeping out terrorists, extremist, violent criminals, rapists, murderers. And we also, I have to say, our border patrol and ICE have done an incredible job. You know, ICE has removed thousands, thousands of MS-13 out of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:11:56"
"Donald Trump","And not a lot of people want that job. That’s a tough job. That’s a day. You got to be a certain type of person. You don’t want it, this handsome guy with the sunglasses. You don’t want it. He doesn’t want to be a member of ICE. They go into what they call a nest and the fists are flying and everything. And then they walk out and that’s the end of that. No, these guys are tough and smart and you know what? They love our country. And we love them, too.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:12:46"

"Donald Trump","We invested $2.5 trillion in the United States military. We have the greatest equipment any nation has ever had. When I came, a highly overrated general told me, “Sir, we have no ammunition.” We maybe had to do something. “We have no ammunition, sir.” I said, “No president should ever hear that again.” Anyway, we spent $2.5 trillion and we have the greatest equipment, missiles, rockets, tanks, planes, fighter jets, ships, tankers, bombers. We have the greatest equipment. We have, I call it the super-duper missiles that go very fast, hydrosonic. Super-dupers, they go five to seven times faster than the fastest missile in the world. They go so fast you can’t do anything. And by the way, our nuclear is rebuilt, replenished. And here’s what you have to do. We had no choice. It was not in good shape. Hope to God, we never have to use any of this equipment, okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:13:10"
"Donald Trump","And the best way you don’t have to use it is if you have it, okay. But we have the best ever that we’ve ever had. All made in the USA, by the way, every ounce of it. And we launched the first new branch of the US Armed Forces in 75 years, United States Armed Forces, 75 years, think of it, the Space Force. Which people, really, look, a couple of them made the statement, whether you like them or not, I made promises during the campaign, but some of them say I actually produced more than the promises I made, as opposed, most politicians never keep their promises.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:14:15"
"Donald Trump","But think of it, Space Force. I never talked about Space Force. I realized after being here for a year and a half, I said, Russia’s doing big stuff out in space. China’s doing big. I said, “We got to have a Space Force.” They were not happy when this happened, but we got it through Congress. Thanks to your congressmen and various other people. We did a good job. Thank you, man. We did a good job. We have Space Force and it’s going to end up being one of our most important, without question.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:15:02"
"Donald Trump","I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran nuclear deal, $150 billion for nothing. Here’s 150 billion. 1.8 billion in cash. I’m even more impressed with that. Think of it. Cash. $1.8 billion they got. Ane we got nothing. We got nothing. In fact that agreement’s almost going to expire if we didn’t terminate it, which we did. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they Were working for it. 52 years, they’d come in every year. They’d fly in with those beautiful jets and everybody would come in and they’d have lunch. And they’d talk two or three days, then they’d leave. 52 years that went on. I did it in about two hours. Golan Heights. And instead of endless war, we are forging peace in the Middle East. No blood on the sand. No blood. No blood.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:15:29"
"Donald Trump","I did more in 47 months, then sleepy Joe Biden did in 47 years, which is true. Now the Democrats are pushing the most far left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee. The Biden plan would destroy social security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. His running mate co-sponsors a socialist healthcare plan to ban private insurance. A lot of you have private insurance. We have 180 million people and they love their private insurance and they want it. They don’t want to go into a hospital ward when they have a cold, they want to have their private insurance and they want their doctor and they want their plan. And Obama said that, “You can have your doctor and you can have your plan.” And he said it 28 times and he lied. Biden also supports abolishing school choice and charter schools. It’s not going to happen. In a second term, I will provide school choice to every parent in America. A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. It’s a vote for the American dream. That’s what we’re doing. And in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. We will hire more police and thank you to law enforcement for being here. You’re all over. We love our police. Thank you. Thank you. We have a lot of law enforcement here. I said to Biden during the debate, I said, “Name one law enforcement group that supported you.” And Chris Wallace bailed him out. Then I said, “Say the words law and order.” Just law and order nothing fancy, law and order. We just want law and order. Everybody wants that. And he said, “He didn’t want to get involved.” And then Chris Wallace bailed him out again. I said, “No, no, no, you can’t do that.” Because I was really debating two people. No, I was really debating one, Chris Wallace.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:16:38"
"Donald Trump","But I said, “Name it, name it.” Then I think he said, didn’t he say something like, “Oh, law order and safety and security,” and all this. He wanted to soften it up because the radical left will throw him overboard with that. No, I said, “Say law and order.” But he couldn’t do it, but he got bailed out. But we’s going to increase penalties, so assaults. If you take a look at what’s going on with assaults, we are going to take care of our police. And when they do bad things to our police, the people that do it are going to suffer the consequences. I think I have every police group in the nation. In fact, they had down as part of the script, I was supposed to read them. I said, “I can’t read that long.” I would have been reading here all day long. We literally have every police group in the nation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:18:58"
"Donald Trump","We even got the endorsement of New York City Police. They’ve never done it before. We got the endorsement of Chicago Police. And that’s tough because, they never did it. We’ve got every law enforcement. We’ve got Florida, Texas. We’ve got everybody. They’re all with us.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:19:47"

"Donald Trump","We do have New York, that’s right. But I just want to thank them because they’re incredible. And they take a lot of abuse and they don’t realize it, the people of our country love them. Just realize it. And we will ban deadly sanctuary cities. Get them out of here. Nobody wants them. The only one’s want them are the politicians. The people in California don’t want them. The politicians want them. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, second amendment. We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens and we will keep America out of endless, ridiculous foreign Wars of places you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might and we will ensure peace through strength.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:20:08"
"Donald Trump","We will end surprise medical billing, that surprise medical billing is a bad deal and it’s now ending, require price transparency, all signed up. Goes into effect January 1. Can you imagine if the sleepy guy gets in and it’s January 1, and everybody says this price transparency, I’ll tell you what, it’s bigger than healthcare. Wait’ll you see. It’s bigger than healthcare, you talk about pricing, bigger. And can you imagine, and he’ll get credit for it. They’ll say, “Biden did a phenomenal job on price.” People have been trying to get this thing for 25 years. I got it done in January. I said to my people, “Couldn’t you do it like from six, seven months ago.” But they had statutory limits. You had to wait here, there, that. So on January 1, I better damn well be president, I’ll tell you. Well, I will be.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:21:06"
"Donald Trump","I will be. Yeah, for 20 days. Don’t do this to me. Don’t do it that. You can’t do that. No, no. So January 1, it goes into effect. We go out to January 20th. But you know what? I honestly believe, I don’t think we’re going to have to worry about it. I think we’re going to have price transparency. We’ll be here for four years. And then if we decide to go for an extra four or eight.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:21:56"

"Donald Trump","12, I think 12 is going to be now the gold standard. Hey, that’ll be the new chant. And the other thing we’re doing, as you know, is to further reduce the cost of prescription drugs. We’ve reduced it the first time in 51 years anyone’s got. But now we’re talking a big because I’ve instituted a favored nations laws. And I also got rid of the middlemen. The middlemen were making a fortune and yesterday I said, “I’ll bet you,” right, “I’ll bet you Hunter Biden is a middleman, too.” These middlemen have made a fortune. They make more money than the drug companies, the middlemen. It’s all because of horrible legislation and crazy things.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:22:41"
"Donald Trump","And we’re thinking that probably Hunter Biden got a big piece of the action, too, for his father. Did you see the letter where the father is supposed to get 10% of everything? The father’s, he’s running for president. He is a national security risk. We will strongly protect Medicare and social security. And we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:23:20"
"Donald Trump","America will land the first woman on the moon and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars. And that’s very exciting. And all of that is happening. We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. That’s happening.

"Donald Trump","And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, in God we trust. They’re not going to remove it. For years, you had a president who apologized for America. Now you have a president who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Michigan. And I’ve been doing that long before I even thought about running for office. It’s true though, when I came here, I don’t know, 10, 12 years ago, it was always my number one issue. How come our country is being ripped off so badly by other countries. So I’m probably here because of Michigan, maybe more than any other race if you think about it. So get your friends, get your family, get your coworkers, get your boss, if you have a boss and he’s a little lazy, say, “Boss, you get your ass out of that chair and get out and vote.” Get out and vote.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-michigan-rally-speech-transcript-october-17","Donald Trump Michigan Rally Speech Transcript October 17","01:24:23"
