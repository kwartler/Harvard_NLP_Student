"President Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. And hello, Florida. I love Florida. It’s great to be with you and back at The Villages. I like The Villages.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","00:00"
"President Donald Trump","Turn the mic up. It’s great to be with you. It’s something I’ve wanted to do. I was here four years ago in some little ballroom that held about 400 people. And I said, “I want to be with The Village, everybody.” I said, “Get a field or do something. Just go out and get a field. Go out and get a field.” And that’s what they did. You got a lot of people here. And I see you driving around in those beautiful golf carts, the most beautiful carts. I wanted to get one. I’m going to get a golf cart like that. But you have the best and you’re always fighting for me and I’m always fighting for you. And I appreciate it. That’s why we’re here.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","00:36"
"President Donald Trump","And we had an exciting night last night with Sleepy Joe. But I’m always here to protect you, and love, cherish, defend our nation, seniors. And not all of you are seniors. I see a lot of people that are very young here. [inaudible 00:01:40]. And I see a lot of people that are young at heart, right? We’re young at heart, all of us, and the timeless values that make this nation the greatest nation anywhere in the world. Eleven days from now, we’re going to win the state of Florida. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. I think Joe Biden proved last night that he’s not capable of being President of the United States. Come on, Gabe. The country saw firsthand that this election is a choice between a Trump recovery, and I’ll call it because that’s what’s happening, it’s a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression because you will have a depression. Who has 401(k)s in this group? Anybody? If he got in, wave bye-bye to your 401(k) because it’s going down the tubes. It’s a choice between optimism, patriotic vision for American success, or Joe Biden’s dark, dismal, gloomy. Did you hear what he said last night about darkness, darkness, always darkness? But it’s a gloomy vision. We’re about the American dream, all about the American dream, greatest country in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","01:23"
"President Donald Trump","Joe Biden is totally controlled by the radical socialist left. This country will never be a socialist country. Never. One of the most stunning moments last night was when Joe Biden admitted that he wants to abolish the oil industry. That wasn’t too good. Did you see him this morning? This morning, “I didn’t really need that. I didn’t mean that.” It was the last question they talked about that. I said, “Whoa, this is the big point of the evening.” Remember, I said, “Well, you want to get rid of oil and gas?” Is that … “Yeah, well, we want to phase it out.” I said, “Thank you. Texas are you watching? Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, Ohio are you watching now?”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","03:12"
"President Donald Trump","Now they’re going around, Kamala. Kamala is going around saying, “No, no, no. We want to keep it.” This woman is a super radical left. She’s against fracking. If they get in, they’ll end your energy independence. We have energy independence right now. They will end it very quickly. Now they’re going around trying to make … That was one of the, well, we’re going to have to see how it works out, but that could be one of the worst mistakes made in presidential debate history. We’re going to see. We hope it is. This is perhaps the most shocking admission ever made during a debate, where he goes in and he says no fracking. But he’s been saying it, no fracking. He got the nomination, all of the sudden, he’s fracking. No fossil fuels and no gas-powered cars. Ultimately, let’s not have cars. Let’s get rid of airplanes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","03:59"
"President Donald Trump","How about that Senator from Hawaii, where she went along with the Green New Deal? When she said, “Yes, I’m in favor.” I said, “Yeah, but you’re not allowed to use airplanes under the Green New Deal.” And she’s in Hawaii. She said, “Well, I don’t know what to tell you.” And she says, “Maybe we can build a bridge to Hawaii instead.” She’s a beauty, isn’t she? She’s great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","04:49"
"President Donald Trump","Biden’s plan would mean American seniors have no air conditioning during the summer, no heat during the winter, and no electricity during peak hours. It’s true. He wants wind. He wants to wind. When the wind doesn’t blow, “Let’s watch the president tonight, Darling, on television.” “I’m sorry, we can’t do it. The wind’s not blowing tonight.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","05:12"
"President Donald Trump","Last night, Biden pledged to institute the most horrible and dangerous immigration policy ever in this country, catch and release. He wants to bring it back. It took me two years to get rid of it. That’s where you catch a criminal, it could be a rapist, could be a murder, a real criminal, and you just released criminal and say, “Please come back in four years.” Did you see what he said last night? He said, “Oh, and then they come back for court.” I said, “No, they don’t come back, Joe, 1%.” He said, “They come back.” No. I said, “Joe, you don’t know anything about it. They don’t come back.” This a very bad policy, Joe. They don’t come back. They need Perry Mason, but they don’t Perry Mason. They just don’t come back. Criminals and rapists and even murders are set free and they’re set free into our country. It’s ended now. It was very hard to get ended. What I had to do to end it, I will not tell you. I will not tell the people of The Villages. I won’t tell the people of The Villages.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","05:34"
"President Donald Trump","And by the way, you love it here, right? I don’t know. It’s an incredible, popular place. I see it so much. It’s incredible, the love, the spirit. So do you love the people that developed it? I think so, right? Right. It’s nice to have somebody but that wasn’t the same love as you had for the … No, no. Somebody did a good job.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","06:34"

"President Donald Trump","Look, it’s Uncle Sam. Come here, Uncle Sam. Look at this guy. Look. This is a hell of a day. Mr. Congressman, how are you? When are you getting married? Are you getting married soon? [inaudible 00:07:33] Don’t lose her, Congressman. You’ll be very depressed.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","07:23"
"President Donald Trump","Biden says America is nothing more than an idea, right? He also said, didn’t he say Antifa is just an idea too? So he’s saying … Only at The Villages could you say it. He said America was an idea. But come to think of it, he said Antifa’s an idea too, right? Well, America is not an idea. It’s a great country. I’ll tell you, it’s a great country. And America is our home. It’s a nation and it’s a nation that has borders. When you have borders, you have a nation. You take away the borders … They want to take away the borders. They want to take down the wall. The wall is now 400-plus miles long. How about that? And it goes very high and very low. It goes down deep for two reasons. To hold it up is one. That’s a good reason, but also for the tunnels.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","07:37"
"President Donald Trump","And Arizona’s very happy. We just got back, Pam, some numbers from Arizona. Very good. Numbers from Florida, I don’t want to talk to you, but look at all the fake news back there. I don’t want to talk about it. I don’t want to talk about it. Look at all those people. There’s the great John Roberts, who’s generally speaking, very good. John, generally. But he has bad moments. Hello, John. You having a good time? He’s a good guy. John is good. John is good. They’re not all fake, just about 85% of them. But isn’t it amazing? Some day, I’d like to make a speech without any press. Without any press. One little mistake and they try and take you out.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","08:34"
"President Donald Trump","And I do this four times a day. It’s crazy. So we’re going on a tour for the next 10 days. Can you believe it? We’re down to 10, 11 days. And we’ll be doing two or three of these and then four these, and then we’re going to end up five or six of these a day. Do you believe it? Is this any kind of a life? Is this a life? Who can do that? Who can do that? Do you think Sleepy Joe can do that? I don’t think so. I don’t think so. I don’t think he can do it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","09:25"

"President Donald Trump","I knew there was a reason I wanted to be at The Villages. This is a hard thing. This was very hard. They said, “They have no field that’s large enough.” I said, “Do have a polo field someplace? Let’s get a polo field.” Looking at that equipment. Look at those helicopters. How good are they? Everything is good. 2.5 trillion, we should have good helicopters.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","10:09"
"President Donald Trump","But if Biden wins, your borders will be gone and your country will be gone, frankly., Look, this is not a man that’s capable. When I meet with these heads of state, the one thing I can tell you, they’re sharp. They’re sharp. They’re not off. They’re sharp. This is not a man that can handle the job. He leaves his house this morning, he gets up, and I’m going to talk about it. All he talks about is COVID, COVID, COVID because they want to scare people. And we’ve done so well with it. Now it’s 99.8%. I mean, you look at what’s going on and we’re rounding the turn. We’re rounding the corner. We’re rounding the corner beautifully. But Joe Biden was very disrespectful last night to President Barack Hussein Obama. You saw that. Barack Hussein Obama. Remember Rush Limbaugh would always do that. He’d do, “Barack Hussein Obama.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","10:32"
"President Donald Trump","And Rush is doing okay. Rush is great, isn’t he? Do we love Rush? He’s got such guts and he’s going through a lot, but he’s got courage like you people have. He always has had courage. At last night’s debate, though, he was very disrespectful, really disrespectful. When he said that he, Joe, was vice president, not president, blaming Obama when trying to make excuses for the failed immigration policies, right? You saw that? “I wasn’t the president. It was him.” Because we talked about cages, right? I said, ” Joe, you built the cages.” Remember, they tried to say “cages for children.” And they said, “Trump built cages.” And then they found out it was a little problem. There was a picture in the New York Times, the failing New York Times. If you take a look at what its unfunded liability is, check it out sometime. It’s definitely failing. It’s only a question of when.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","11:27"
"President Donald Trump","But you take a look at the failing New York Times and they had a picture of a cage and they thought that I built it. And it said “cage.” And then somebody called me, they said, “Sir, that was built,” one of the people that helped build it, “that was built in 2014.” I said, “2014, I didn’t happen to be president.” It was built under Obama/Sleepy Joe Biden. And so did you notice when I kept saying, “Why did you build the cages, Joe? Why did you?” And he just kept talking. He didn’t want any part of it. But they started it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","12:19"
"President Donald Trump","If you want jobs, safety, and borders, you have to vote for the party of Abraham Lincoln, Honest Abe. Vote Republican. And I’m voting early tomorrow in Florida. Do you believe that? I’m coming to vote. I came down here to vote. I actually came down here to see The Villages, and tomorrow morning I’m voting here as opposed to sending it in, you know, just mail it. I liked being able to vote. I’m old fashioned I guess. I like to get online and I have to stand there for two hours, maybe they’ll move you up a little bit. But I liked the vote. So I’m coming, I’m going to be voting here tomorrow. And I urge every one of you to go and vote. And I don’t think I have to urge too many. How many people here have already voted? That’s incredible. Thank you. Look at you.

"President Donald Trump","How many people here have voted for Sleepy Joe Biden, please? I don’t see any hands. I tend to believe them. Sleepy Joe, no, he’s not the guy. For 47 years, Joe Biden sent American jobs to China and other nations while the Bidens vacuum up. Look, did you see what’s going on with his son? I mean, he goes into a country, the guy leaves with volumes of money, vacuum up millions of dollars all over the globe. Last night, Joe lied straight to the American people. He claimed that he had never taken a penny from any foreign source, ever in my life, ever. I mean, he goes to think of it, his son, without a job knows nothing about energy. These young people in the front, do you know anything about energy? No. She said, no. She knows more than Hunter. Remember, where is Hunter? By the way, where the hell is Hunter? Where’s Hunter? Remember the t-shirt? I said one time, “Where’s Hunter,” the next day they had a t-shirt, “Where’s Hunter?” There he is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","13:54"
"President Donald Trump","Hunter, you gained weight. But you look even better. You still look better. Anyway. No, but think of it, he gets lined up with this Ukrainian energy company, not the highest reputation. $ 183,000 a month to be on the board, right? Gets a $3 million upfront payment. Then that’s only the first nation that he goes. He has no knowledge of energy whatsoever. Anybody in this audience knows more. They then go to China. Let’s go to China. He gets 1.5 billion to manage, meaning millions of dollars a year in fees. He then goes to Russia, he got three and a half million from the mayor of Moscow’s wife, three and a half million dollars. And Obama was in charge of all of that stuff.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","15:15"
"President Donald Trump","Then they stole the premier, they stold the submarine port, Russia. And Russia takes it. And he’s in charge of Russia, but he got three and a half million dollars. So what’s going on with that? So he was in charge of Ukraine, China, Russia. That was sort of a responsibility of the vice president. And he got money from all of them. And he got it from his son and the son made no money for years. And all of a sudden he’s making all this money. They’re corrupt politicians. Okay. You say what you want.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","16:03"
"President Donald Trump","And then you see the notes, and you see the gentleman that got up yesterday and you see what he had to say. He’s a legitimate person. But you see the notes that you see that Joe gets 10% of everything, right? And Pammy got 50% of something. And then the guy has the deal in China where he wants to get $10 million a year, 10 million a year for introductory purposes. In other words, he’s going to introduce people. You know who he’s going to introduce, his father, that’s who he’s going to introduce. It’s a bad deal. It’s a bad deal. It’s corrupt as hell. I don’t care what you say. It’s corrupt as hell. Okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","16:34"
"President Donald Trump","And they like to also, when they say, “Oh, well, what about you and your kids?” I don’t do deals. I don’t do deals. I used to do more deals. I was the king of deals. But I don’t do deals. Like you tell my kids, you can’t, it’s a conflict, just don’t do it. So, it’s possibly allowed. It probably is allowed. But I say, “We don’t need it. Just don’t do them.” My kids, these kids have done such a good job. They have done such a good job.

"President Donald Trump","The Bidens got rich while America got robbed. And how did Biden get so wealthy spending a half a century in public office? He’s been in public office for 47 years, almost 50 years. He used his office for personal profit at your expense, and my expense, and all of our expenses. In 2016, Florida voted to fire this [inaudible 00:18:08] political establishment. And you elected an outsider as president who is finally putting America first and putting The Villages first, putting The Villages. We’re putting The Villages first. And if I don’t sound like a typical Washington politician it’s because I’m not a politician. And if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, the deep state, the RINOs. The RINOs are almost worse than our enemy. The RINOs, we love those RINOs. Republican in name only. You know what that is, right? Republican in name only. We got a lot of them.

But if I don’t always play by the rules of the Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fought for you harder than any president has ever fought for anybody.

You see all the commercials the drug companies are running against me? It’s unbelievable. It’s unbelievable. This is why I see politicians. This is one of the many reasons why. The other reason is that the biggest lobbyist, the biggest donator by far are the drug companies. Very powerful, a lot of money. They are taking commercials at me. I don’t care. I’m doing the right thing. I instituted a favored nations clause where the United States, right now we pay the highest price of any country in the world by far, it’s not even close. It’s not even close. You can have a pill that sells for 25 cents identical and in the United States could sell for $3. That’s how bad it is. It’s terrible. So I instituted what we call a favored nations clause. So we will now go, we will be paying the lowest price, match the lowest price anywhere in the world.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","19:31"

In fact, the governor is going to go to Canada. I gave him the right. He’s going to Canada, where they pay 50% less for the same drug. And he’s going to buy for the state of Florida, until this favored nations kicks in, where you go down 70, 80, 90%. And last year was the first year in 53 years, that drug prices in this country went down. Not by much, but they went down. They didn’t go up. 1%, not much, not proud, 1%, but with favored nations, you’ll go down 50, 60, 70, maybe even 80% in drug prices. But I gave your governor the right to go to Canada and buy drugs in Canada. The same exact drug from the same factory, same company, 50% and even more discount.

Would have been great. I would have been so proud of it, but now I don’t view it the same. Normal life. That’s all we want. Normal life will fully resume. We had the greatest economy in our history.

Who knows if they’re right. We’re going to see. Here’s the goodness news, it’s going to be announced right before November 3rd, right before. And I’m willing to take my chances, being a gambling man, I’m willing to take my chances.

And I’ve been given a lot of help with some of the people over here. I gave you the largest tax cut and reforms in American history, and we will cut taxes further. And we’re cutting taxes for the middle class. We’re cutting taxes for people that need jobs and nobody’s ever done it at a level like we’ve done it. By contrast sleepy Joe Biden will give you the single biggest tax hike in the history of our country. He’s talking about quadrupling taxes, 4 trillion in taxes so he can waste it on the green new deal. The green new deal, no cars, no airplanes, no cows.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","24:42"
"President Donald Trump","No cows, you know. Whatever happened? Did they ever leave the cows in? I think they had to take that out, right [inaudible 00:06:53]. Originally, it was no cows. They didn’t want to have any cattle or cows, which is pretty brutal when you think of it, right? He’ll bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, terminate religious liberty, destroy your suburbs. I’m always saying, I’ll tell you this, the fraudulent media. So I always get up and I have fun. Please, please, suburban women. You should love me. I ended the regulation that’s going to destroy the suburbs.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","25:47"

I said, “Why?” Last time I was supposed to be doing terribly with women, then I got 52%. They said, what the hell happened with Trump and women all of a sudden? Remember they said Trump did well with women. So how’d it go? Hey, so I get it, I get it. I say, “Please, please, suburban women, please, please love me, suburban women. I want you to love me because I got rid of the regulation that’s going to destroy your neighborhood. You don’t want to have projects next year house.

She goes, “You were begging, you were begging suburban women to love you, weren’t you?” I said, “No, no, I was just having fun. We were just having fun.” These people are sick. They are bad. They are bad. But they want to decimate Florida seniors and seniors, all seniors, okay? And by the way, what I’ve done for suburban women, but suburban people, people that live in the suburbs, that’s really the dream. That’s the American dream. And you know, 30% of the people, because people say, “Oh, is that racist?” 30% of the people living in the suburbs are minority groups, Hispanic American, black American.

"President Donald Trump","For years Joe Biden fought to cut your social security. He wanted to cut it. He wanted to knock it out and Medicare, which Joe has now falsely denied. You notice? Oh, I loved it yesterday. The way he denied that. So does that mean you want to get rid of fossil fuel Joe? Oh yes. That’s what it means. Thank you. This debate let’s end it. Let’s end it right now. By the way I got treated, I thought, very fairly by the anchor. I thought, right, Kristen, I was surprised. She’s been a little bit rough on me over the years. I was surprised, but her network has been crazy, NBC con test, C-O-N con test. I thought Kristen did a very good job yesterday. Some people said she interrupted me much more than she interrupted sleep Joe. But that’s because he didn’t have that much to say, so. But no, I thought she was fair. I said it to her in the show, I said, “I think you’ve handled it very professionally.” It’s not easy. So today I want to show you Joe Biden’s own words. The video I’m about to play was created by Bernie Sanders, crazy Bernie. You know, Bernie is the single greatest loser. The way he loses, he gets sportsmanship of the year, right? What they did to him four years ago was quite terrible. What they did to him was even… Then he just goes back to Congress and talks. He’s crazy Bernie. A lot of his people are going to come with us because you know why? They love our trade policy. Because he, like me, understands how badly we’ve been taken advantage of by other countries, including our allies by the way. The video I’m about to play was created by crazy Bernie earlier this year to expose Joe Biden’s atrocious record and his egregious lies.

You can’t do it. And it would obliterate your Medicare and your social security, totally obliterate it. Joe Biden cares more about illegal aliens that he does about senior citizens. And that’s true.

Pocahontas, if she would have gotten out three days early, it’s true. She took all of Bernie’s on Super Tuesday. It’s true. Do you agree with that, Congressman? She took all of his votes away. All he needed was a few more of us. He would have won every state. So you have somebody that really got a little bit lucky. In prime time, they used to call him 1% Joe.

You have many, many countries that have very few cases because they don’t do testing. We test. We have tests like you wouldn’t believe.

He’s running for President. Think of it. We have this guy that can’t even speak and he goes, “We’re entering a dark winter.” So inspirational, but he’s trying to scare people, basically. He’s trying to get something because he’s been such a failure at every level of government that this is something. But what they don’t remember is the swine flu and how bad it was.

Do you live at the villages? I don’t think so. Do you? You don’t. Do you really? This guy lives at the villages. I think I’ll move in. I have an idea. I will sell Mar-A-Lago, and I’ll move to the villages. You know what? It’s not the worst idea. I like that idea. I like that idea. I like the people here. We’ll have 100 million vaccine doses before the end of this year and seniors will be the first in line. We’re taking care of our seniors. Under my plan, you will get incredible lifesaving therapies. Our therapies are incredible. Remdesivir just got approved. You saw that.

"President Donald Trump","And the FDA has moved at a pace that they’ve never moved before. They’re approving things in weeks which used to take years. That’s a little prodding for me, I have to be honest with you. But they’re doing it. They’re doing it. They’re doing a great job. You will get a vaccine that ends the epidemic or the pandemic and it ends it and eradicates it. But without it, it goes away. But with it, it goes away faster, and it’s going to happen very, very soon. You’re going to have it very soon. A lot of great companies are right there. You’ll get to see your friends, families, and loved ones and you’ll get to enjoy being with them in their golden years. It’s a sad thing where you can’t be near people. I mean, did you ever hear of anything like this? You can’t be near people when they’re in trouble. But where we’re going to be very close. We’re very, very close. You watch.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","50:46"
"President Donald Trump","Under Biden’s land, you’ll be locked down for years. The cure will be worse than the problem itself. Remember that. You’ve got to lead your life. And you know what? Some people want to say it and that’s good. Do it, do it. I’m like, lead your life, right? And some people agree with me. But if you want to stay in, if you want to do what you’re doing, you do it. If you want to get out and you want to be careful and socially distance and all of the things, you could wear a mask if you can’t socially distance, but there are a lot of things you can do. But some people want to stay in. And that’s okay. There’s nothing wrong with it. But you’re going to have a vaccine and it’s going to be an incredible success.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","51:34"
"President Donald Trump","Wait until you see these vaccines that they’re coming out with, and you’re going to have therapeutics and therapies and cures. To me, the cure or the therapy is more important than the vaccine. Not everybody agrees. I think you go in, and even the fact that it’s there, Regeneron, it had a hell of an effect on me. And somebody said I looked better last night than I used to. And I said, “I think it was Regeneron.” But to me, I don’t know, maybe not everybody agrees, but to me knowing that there’s something that can knock it out, to me, is actually more important than a vaccine. But the vaccines are coming. Therapeutics are already here and coming, and, in my opinion, the therapeutics in some cases are already cures.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","52:17"
"President Donald Trump","Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. So it’s called Make America Great Again, Again. Right? Make America Great Again, Again. So we’re going to change all the hats. You’re going to have to go out to buy a new one. It’s going to have again, again, exclamation point. In my first three years, we increased family income over $6,000, more than five times the gains in all eight years under the last administration. Think of what that means. African American unemployment, Hispanic American unemployment, and Asian American unemployment all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. we lifted nearly seven million Americans out of poverty, including more than 1.5 million Hispanic Americans. And when the virus hit, we experienced the smallest contraction, think of that, the smallest of any major country and the fastest recovery of any country in the world. We’re recovering at a level that nobody’s seen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","53:04"

When you look at Michigan, although we just won the court case against her, the only one that was given freedom was her husband, he was the only one that was allowed to go sailing on the lake. Nobody else could do it. But we just won the case. It was unconstitutional what she was doing. She was running it like a prison camp. And you have Pennsylvania, you have North Carolina, and you have other places, they’ve got to open them up. I guarantee, November 4th they’ll say, “Well, we’ve decided to open.” They just want to keep the numbers down as much as possible. It’s not going to help them. Since April, we’ve created a record 11.4 million jobs. Under Biden, it 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost to the crisis. We did it in five months.

It was the slowest recovery since 1929. We’ve achieved energy independence, and we’ve done it while protecting our pristine environment. I recently signed an order placing a moratorium on offshore drilling off the coast of Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and I decided to add Florida. Is that okay? We added Florida. We didn’t want to make you too unhappy. No, we added Florida right at the beginning. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing the wall 400 miles and Mexico is paying for the wall. You do know that, okay? They like to say, “After years of fighting for it,” I made a terrible mistake, I should have said, “We will not build the wall. We will never ever build a wall. We will never build the wall,” and the Democrats would have insisted that I build it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-speech-transcript-the-villages-florida-october-23","Donald Trump Rally Speech Transcript The Villages, Florida October 23","55:16"

And we send our sincere best wishes to the President Macron who’s doing a good job, not an easy job. I’m keeping the terrorist jihadist and violent extremist out of our country.

We invested $2.5 trillion in rebuilding our US military. It’s the best and strongest it’s ever been, all made in the USA. With the best equipment in the world, hypersonic rockets go seven times faster than what we have right now. Think of it, we have the greatest military than we’ve ever had.

We just got a 91% approval rating from the Vets. That’s never happened. It’s never been anyone near there. You ever remember, you were growing up, we were living it, every night they’d have on the news these horror stories about the Vets and how bad they were? You don’t see that anymore.
