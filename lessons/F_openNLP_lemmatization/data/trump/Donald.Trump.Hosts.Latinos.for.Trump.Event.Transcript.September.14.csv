"President Donald J. Trump","The fake news, they said that this is supposed to be a roundtable, but it looks like a rally, but it is a rally because we love each other. No, it is a roundtable and we’re here to really listen. We’re here to discuss the Latinos and the Hispanic Americans. I want to say you have a great Governor. He has been fantastic. Thank you. I love you, too. And we’re really doing well. The country is doing numbers that… You will see. Next year is going to be, you know, you had your greatest year ever, Doug, last year, the best year you ever had. Then we had to close it up. We had to stop and we saved millions of lives by doing it. We saved millions of lives. And then we restarted and now we’ve set all kinds of records and we’re setting records. And I think next year you’re going to have a fantastic year. It’s going to be great. We’re cutting taxes even further. And we’re going to have big growth. A lot of good things happening.

"President Donald J. Trump","This is good. You know, this is what the polls are all saying too. As a Republican, Republicans don’t do as well as perhaps they should.

They’re great business people. Great, great business people. I know that because I’ve had to compete with them. They’re not easy to compete with. I want to say that. Hispanic Americans strengthen our nation beyond description. You protect our nation as brave members of the military and as members of law enforcement, great, great members of law enforcement. You uplift the communities and promote our shared values of faith and family, community, hard work and patriotism. You’re an amazing group of people.

"President Donald J. Trump","Joe Biden has spent 47 years selling out the Hispanic American community, sending your jobs to China, raising your taxes, surging regulations. I don’t know. He doesn’t sound too good to me. He’s coming up once every three, four days. I’ve been in every state. I’ve been in so many states the last few days. Yeah. Well you need a lot of energy to do this job properly. You can’t be sitting in your basement for four days and come out. No, and then he comes out and I like Delaware. I think Delaware is a good place, but you got to leave it on occasion, you know. I mean, he comes up.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","06:52"
"President Donald J. Trump","And remember, they say that his home state is Pennsylvania. No, no, no. He left Pennsylvania when he was young. It’s not his fault. Hiss father left, okay, and his mother. They left, but they left Pennsylvania when he was very young. And we just had a great ruling. Doug and I were talking. Just literally minutes ago, a federal judge, a very prominent, a very respected federal judge came out and ruled that they can’t shut the state down any longer. It’s too much. They can’t do it. He said it was unconstitutional and it was a great ruling.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","07:33"
"President Donald J. Trump","And we hope that’s going to happen in North Carolina. We hope that it’s going to happen in North Carolina. We hope it’s going to happen in Michigan too, because it’s just totally shut down. Well, you know what’s going to happen. On November 4th, they’ll open up everything. They’re just doing it. on November 4th, they’ll announce everything’s open now. You know, we were only kidding. The fact is that November 4th, you’re going to see it’s going to all open up. It’s going to all open up. It’s politics.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","08:10"
"President Donald J. Trump","So if you know, and as Hispanic Americans, you know better than anybody, we implemented historic tax cuts and regulation cuts, the biggest in the history of our country. And we built opportunity zones that have really benefited your state and a lot of other states. And it’s been great for everybody, really, African Americans. And if you look at the African American, what they’ve done and how that’s benefited them, was I was helped by Tim Scott of South Carolina. And he’s a fantastic Senator. And he came in the idea of the opportunity zone, but for African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, and really everybody, it’s been a tremendous success.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","08:37"
"President Donald J. Trump","Before the China virus came in, we achieved the lowest Hispanic American unemployment rate ever recorded ever. Not even close. Over 600,000 Hispanic Americans were lifted out of poverty in that short period of time. That’s a record. All records, Hispanic American ownership, home ownership reached an all time high. And that includes Arte’s home. Okay? That includes the home. Okay. That must be a nice home. I want to see that home. But it’s the highest home ownership ever in the history of our country for Hispanic Americans. We built the greatest economy in history and now we’re doing it again. So it’s called make America great again. And I say, make America great again and again. Again and again.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","09:19"
"President Donald J. Trump","And we added, as you’ve probably heard, we added 3.3 million jobs for Hispanic Americans in the last four months. That’s a record. So we’re coming back very, very strong. I call it the super V. In July, I launched the White House Hispanic Prosperity Initiative to improve access to education and economic development and opportunity for all Hispanic Americans. It’s been a very big success. We have great people on the board. And we have that Biden would, as you know, terminate this recovery because if a doctor said, “Let’s shut it down,” we have all these records. We have retail sales records, everything. He said he’d shut it down. Can’t shut it down. Peaceful protesters. Have you seen his peaceful protesters? These are not. They’ll rip down your community. Many of these are Hispanic, American, small businesses, stores, shops, and they rip them down and they call it peaceful protesting.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","10:14"
"President Donald J. Trump","You see some of these reporters on television, they’re saying, “Yes, this has been a peaceful protest.” And over his shoulder, it’s a pretty famous clip. The entire city is burning down. And these are all Democrat mayors, super liberal usually, but Democrat mayors and governors. Republicans are doing very well. Republican cities and states are doing incredibly well. We’re at records. We have been at records. We will be at records and we don’t have anything like this. Nobody’s ever seen anything like this. And we’ve sent the National Guard into Minneapolis and we ended it after a week and a half. They should have called it sooner. We would solve the problem in Portland in I say less than a half an hour. It would be solved. But they don’t want to call us. They don’t want to call us in.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","11:04"
"President Donald J. Trump","Every place we’ve gone, we solve it immediately. Seattle is an example. They took over a piece of the city and we said, “What are you doing?” And we complained, complained. We said, “That’s okay. We have to go in because we’re supposed to wait. We’re going in. And we’re going in tomorrow.” And we informed them we’re going in. As soon as we did that, they had people go in and these wise guys gave up, those so-called protesters. They gave up. They’re anarchists. They’re not protesters. They’re agitators and they’re anarchists.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","11:53"
"President Donald J. Trump","So, you see what happens with the anti-police rhetoric from that whole group of Democrats and their supporters. They’re endangering our law enforcement. We love our law enforcement. Many, many of the law enforcement are Hispanic Americans, as you know. Biden is not a strong person, never was a strong person. In prime time he wasn’t any good. Let’s face it. And this is not prime time for him. This is not prime time. But he’ll surrender your entire country to the radical left. And that’s all they’re doing is using him. He has no clue.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","12:22"
"President Donald J. Trump","So we will take this to a whole different level. What we’re doing is taking it to a whole different level. We don’t want to have a socialist country. Some of you came from parts of the world where it’s socialist or worse. You know, it’s called the C word, right? The C word. Because I think in many cases, these people are talking even beyond socialism and we’re not going to let that happen. We’re not going to let the rule of law really just be ruled by the mob. We’re going to do it. We’re going to do it properly. We’re going to do it the way we’re doing it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","13:04"
"President Donald J. Trump","And again, remember the top 10 are all Democrat. And then you go into the top 25 and you take a look at that. It’s the same thing. It’s all a Democrat problem. Whether it’s New York, where crime is through the roof, it’s gone up in some cases, 150 to 300%, not even recognizable. Or Chicago. You take a look at Chicago, what’s happening. They had numbers that were just absolutely horrible. And I don’t even want to mention it, but so many people shot, so many people killed. Nobody’s ever heard of this. This is a Democrat runs the city. These are Democrats and they have no clue.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","13:37"
"President Donald J. Trump","They have no cash bail. They get rid of bail. They get rid of all of the things that you need. The police are afraid to do anything. They don’t want to lose their pensions. They don’t want to lose their life. They don’t want to lose their family and their job and everything else that comes with it. And we have to give our great law enforcement people, we have to give them the respect that they deserve. And if we don’t do that, they can never do their job properly.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","14:13"
"President Donald J. Trump","Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. And just in closing up, I just say a few words more because it’s so important to me, and your community is so important to me. But many Hispanic Americans came here to pursue the American dream, right? We all want the America. I want the American dream. We all want the American dream. If you look at what they’re asking for, it’s like the American nightmare or whatever you want to call it. But we want the American dream, having left countries that did not have safe streets. Many of you or your family, your mothers, your fathers, they left countries that were very, very bad, very bad, a lot of problems. And if we let this go on, you’d have that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","14:37"
"President Donald J. Trump","And I often say, we’re not going to be another Venezuela. We love the people of Venezuela. We have tremendous support in Miami, from Venezuelans and Cubans. We’re not going to let that happen to our country. Nobody wants it. And you know who wants it least is Hispanic Americans. They want to see it less than anybody because they know about it more than anybody. And so we’re not going to let that happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","15:40"
"President Donald J. Trump","Biden wants to take away your police. He wants to, I wouldn’t say defund in his case, but I will tell you some of his compatriots want to defund your police. Let’s face it. They want to defund your police. They want to take it away. I don’t know who’s going to do the job when they call up at night. You saw the commercial where you call up and they say, “Murder, I’m sorry. We won’t be here for 24 hours.” And then they say, “I’m sorry, rape. We won’t be here for about a week. We’ll call you back in a week.” And this is what you’ll end up with. We can’t do it. We have to treasure our law enforcement. We have to let them do what they’re good at.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","16:01"
"President Donald J. Trump","Another thing I think that’s so important is that we’re defending religious liberty and Joe Biden will totally eliminate religious liberty. He’s going to take away your second amendment because he’s not going to be what I had to put up with in the last four years to defend your second amendment. But you have to have your second amendment. And they’re going to at least obliterate it. They’re going to at least obliterate it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","16:39"

We have so many people doing so well, and school choice. And we’ve been very hard on school choice and we’ll get it very much achieved like we have. Nobody’s done as much as we’ve done in three and a half years. Nobody. No administration in their first three and a half years. I say it. I say this that I’ve achieved more for Hispanic Americans in 47 months than Joe Biden is achieved in 47 years. It’s true. It’s true.

I have great respect for all of you I’ve heard of in one way or another. I want to thank you all for being here. Really, it’s a great honor. And Arte, it’s an honor meeting you.

"President Donald J. Trump","And the relationship with Mexico has been really great. I’ll tell you they have a very good president and we’ve gotten along very well and they’ve actually been very good. We’ve had a real relationship. NAFTA was a disaster for our country and now we have the USMCA, which is Mexico-Canada, and it’s been a great… And we’re not going to lose our businesses now to Mexico and Canada, they’re going to stay right here. So they have a very big economic penalty if they want to play the games of leaving. I mean we lost 55,000 firms went down to different, I mean, different places, but a lot of them went to Mexico, a lot of them went to Canada. There’s a very, very big disincentive to doing that. Well, I’d like to hear, as a baseball fan I’d like to hear from Arte, because he really has done, that team has been glamorized and it’s a great team and great players, great individual players.

My father did not graduate from high school. He always was very positive about, I think his platform was, “If you don’t work, you don’t eat.” I’m a Vietnam vet. I was lucky enough when I came home to get the GI Bill and go to college. I went to the other school down in Tucson. I’m married, I have three great children. My dad was very much Barry Goldwater Republican so were brought up very conservative. Just want to talk a little bit about, because I started my life working for someone, and started with a partner, a small business. And over the years we grew. Everybody deserves the opportunity to grow your own business. It’s a very important thing.

"Speaker 3","My story is as 27, I was elected to the state legislature. I represent a very fast growing area between Phoenix and Tucson that has been in the news quite a bit with companies like Nikola Motors and Lucid Motors announcing their factories there. My family has been in the grocery business since 1952. They moved to Arizona because they failed at hog farming in Iowa, and I think you have to actually try to do that in Iowa. But opened up a business here in Arizona, their first business went bankrupt. They pulled themselves up, got back to work, opened a new grocery store later on, because you can do that in Arizona.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","24:50"

"Speaker 3","Living a wonderful life. And it’s something I think for a lot of the folks out right now to realize. It is difficult to be a minority and Republican at times because your friends, other members of your family, oftentimes don’t understand, treat you differently, things like that. And you experience things that you probably shouldn’t, but we’re a very proud people, very happy to be up here. Actually in a few weeks, I’m going to be getting married to Melissa out there.

"Speaker 4","Thank you Mr. President. I’m here to share my American dream and I want everyone to know that our dream is still alive. The American dream is still alive. And I’m going to tell you a little bit about my story. I came here to the United States when I was 11 years old. My mom worked so hard to support all my siblings. When I was 22 years old, I got shot by the father of my kid, I survived horrible domestic violence. But after I got shot, after a month of getting better, I had two choices to make. One was to survive out of government welfare, survive out of government welfare or get a job. I chose to get a job as a janitor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","27:49"
"Speaker 4","Thank you. Because for so much long, for the first time I felt freedom. I felt that I needed to be free and I didn’t want to be dependent on the government. So I started making $5 an hour in 1997. And I love my job so much that I worked my way up to become a supervisor manager, and then five years later, I ended up buying my company, my own janitorial company. Thank you. Thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","28:32"
"Speaker 4","And for me, that is looking at the American dream. A high school dropout, they didn’t finish high school. I mean, what else can they do but to clean very well and move up the ladder. That is the real American dream.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","29:15"

Going to work eight hours a day, we end up working 16 hours a day for the next five years to pay off the big loans and my fiance, [inaudible 00:09:46], now my husband is here, helped, I mean, put together. So after five years in 2005, we paid it all off. Then after that, I started feeling that I was getting more free and more free and I’m a giver. I like to help. If God takes care of me, I take care of others.

"Speaker 4","So at that time in 2005, I had already 60 employees working for me. And one of the things that I love and do for them is help them learn English, help them buy their first car, help them get their first home. But most of the things that I enjoy the most is teaching them English and make them become US citizens.

That’s when Obamacare came. And I keep hearing in the news, if you have more than 50 employees, you have to cut back or you have to do something. And I told my husband, “What’s going on? Why am I have to lay off people?” And that’s when I started getting involved more into what’s going on. Why is the government telling me what to do? I worked so hard for what I have. Why did they have to get in my business? Why do I have to let people go?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","30:46"

I will tell you, not only with the group that I represent, but as you alluded to earlier in your opening comments, you and your administration have shown tremendous support for law enforcement, since day one. And that is something that we did not see in the previous eight years before you took office. So yes, we thank you for that, and we thank you for the support, and we thank you for the dedication. We know that your attorney general William Barr’s doing a tremendous job.

"Jimmy Chavez","And it’s exciting to be a part of this panel because I think including the audience out here, I think that we can all agree that safer communities provide a benefit and provide economic stability. Because if you don’t have a safe community, who’s going to want to go out? Who’s going to want to go buy things? So this whole idea of defunding the police or cutting costs on law enforcement is something that is counterproductive to what your administration wants, definitely, and what we’ve seen over the last three and a half years, four years, with the economic growth in the country. There is no doubt that many agencies across this country are seeing issues with recruitment, retention, equipment issues, technology that is ever evolving. And I think if we have ideologies that continue to chip away and want to erode law enforcement, I think that’s going to have a significant effect on the communities, significant effect on the citizens, and certainly a significant effect on this country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","36:26"

We’ll be voting for him.” But more than anything, Mr. President, having a small business and talking to hundreds and thousands of people a week, I know that a ton of people are praying for you, are praying for you on this [inaudible 00:42:23].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","41:37"

"Jorge Rivas","My support for you is also, more than anything, is because you show so much love for this country. I have learned to appreciate, respect and love this country so much because of the opportunities and what gives to everyone that comes here, the opportunity to live the American dream. One of the reasons that many of us Latinos like about you is the straightforward way of talking that you have. I do not like when politicians try to make you hear, or they try to tell you what they think you want to hear. Just tell me the way it is, straightforward, and that’s why I think I like you so much. Many immigrants like myself or many other people who their fathers, parents, grandparents came here 100, 200 years ago. We all came through here for similar reasons, for security, for safety, for the opportunity to own our own business and the opportunity to raise our kids and our families in a safe, stable environment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","42:59"
"Jorge Rivas","So that’s one of the reasons why we support you. And so many people support you, people that I know, they support you as well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","44:29"
"President Donald J. Trump","But the real reason is that, I tweeted out, I saw they were giving him a hard time and I tweeted out, this is a great couple. And I looked at him, I said, “Look at this couple.” And they were giving him a hard time and they were trying to do a boycott because this other side is very vicious. They’ll try and do boycotts. So I said, “You know what? It’s not very presidential, but I’m going to do a tweet for Sammy and his beautiful wife.” And you never saw lines like this ever before. And that’s the reason. And I’ll tell you, you’ve been great. And I appreciate it. I hear the places is doing fantastic.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","44:35"
"Jorge Rivas","It’s doing very well. Thank you, Mr. President, thank you very much. And I have a few more things to mention, if you don’t mind.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","45:14"
"President Donald J. Trump","Yeah, go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","45:25"
"Jorge Rivas","Betty, my wife and I, we have been blessed with three excellent young boys, three young men. They’re doing very well in college. And I feel that every kid has the need to be supported or to be loved since they are four or five, six years old, helping them in high school, helping them get through college. We’re, like I said, we’ve been blessed. Our kids are graduating from high school, from college with honors. And I think that part of the problem that we’re having nowadays and so many people are looting, so much hate, breaking windows and stealing somebody else’s property is because the parents are doing a poor job in helping their kids achieve their dreams, their goals.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","45:25"
"Jorge Rivas","So if you are not there, when they are very young, do not expect them to be a very good citizen when they get older. So I feel that we, as parents, we need to do a much better job raising our kids. Because if you’re a person of, either you’re immigrant, you are minority, you are Hispanic or black person. If you’re not helping your kids when they’re very young, do not come with me 10 years, 15 years later, and tell me that you have a sign for me to respect your sign that says, black lives matter. If you are being irresponsible, not helping your kids, I will suggest for you to take your sign, frame it and put it in your house, in your living room and look at it every day and care for your child when they’re young. We need to keep the family structure together, stronger, family dad, because for us, my wife and I work very hard in our business, 12, 14, 16 hours a day, but we always make time to support our children and make sure that their needs were met. We are not rich or anything like that. We make sure that they had hat they needed to succeed. And I think we are failing very miserably on that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","46:23"
"Jorge Rivas","When your opponent is not saying anything about all the destruction that the people are doing out there, they’re only promoting that destruction. So we, as Latinos, we are people that care for our families, people that we call ourselves Christians. We must support someone, in this case, President Trump, to lead this country for another four years.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","48:09"

"Jorge Rivas","Just two more sentence. Okay, I’ll be done. Almost done. I feel, Mr. President, that we, if we call ourselves Christians, we should really think, or maybe those people out there that consider themselves independent, to really think, what do you want your country to look like in 10 years from now? Do you want your kids to have an opportunity to succeed, or do you want to have a breakdown in society where they are not going to have the options to live the American dream? So for those reasons, I feel that it’s extremely important to listen to what the other side saying, because the commercials that I see are all based on lies and hate. Let’s Lie about what President Trump is doing. Let’s lie about… Blame him for COVID-19 or everything else. And they are not showing any structure or any goals or any plans on what they’re going to do. Everything is based on attacking President Trump. Shame on you, Mr. Biden.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","48:57"
"Jorge Rivas","And lastly, just the last thing. As a good business owner, as a entrepreneur, as an American, Mr. President, I wrote a book. I finished writing a book two weeks ago, and I gave one of your White House staff, a book to give it to you. So if you please read it, I think it’s very good.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","50:04"

"Moses Sanchez","Well, thank you, Mr. President, for the opportunity to speak with you today. My name is Moses Sanchez and I’m a legal immigrant from Panama. My family and I came to the United States during the Reagan administration in search of that American dream. And we’ve been pretty good with doctorates, nurses and entrepreneurs in our family that are contributing back to the fabric of this country. I’ve proudly served my country’s Navy combat team for the last 24 years with a tour in Afghanistan in 2011.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","51:46"
"Moses Sanchez","Now for decades, our Hispanic community and persons of color have been accustomed to getting lip service from our political leaders, promises of better schools, safe communities, and economic security. You delivered on all your promises that have improved the circumstances our communities face, historical records in unemployment, home ownership, massive investments into opportunity zones, and an economy that lifts all boats. My daughter, Shannon and I, we own a digital marketing company named, Nonnahs Marketing.

"Moses Sanchez","When you came into office, we had one employee. At the beginning of this year, we had over 12 people in our office working hard, helping other businesses increase and improve their digital footprint. Then COVID hit and it impacted everyone. Our company was no exception. We were fortunate to receive PPP funds during the first round. Many of our clients also received PPP funds. The PPP loan helped us get through the shutdown. And many of our clients were able to stay afloat. Now many are doing better, not fully recovered, but better. COVID and these shutdowns have a huge impact on our economic security, mental, physical, and spiritual wellbeing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","53:29"

"Leah Marquez Peterson","Thank you. Our family has a long history of small business ownership, and that’s really what resonated with me as I was growing up in Arizona. And it’s really those values, those Republican values of less government, more personal responsibility that you’ve heard from any of the other panelists today. I went on to own my own small businesses, a chain of gas stations and convenience stores, as well as a business brokerage firm in the Tucson area also. I’m very proud though, of leading our Tucson Hispanic Chamber, which is one of the largest Hispanic chambers in the nation with more than 1800 members. And during that time, I worked with thousands of small businesses from Pima County, Cochise, Santa Cruz, all throughout Southern Arizona.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","56:41"

"Leah Marquez Peterson","As you’re probably aware, Arizona does more than $16 billion in trade with Mexico. They’re our number one trading partner.

"Leah Marquez Peterson","At the Corporation Commission, I’m working hard to ensure that businesses and families are not going to be hit by the radical California energy policies that a lot of us are seeing now.

That allows our local districts to better respond to their community’s needs rather than wasting valuable resources chasing down one size fits all mandates from Washington DC.

"Pam Kirby","We must stop the indoctrination and instead teach our children to love our country and all she has to offer. And Mr. President, that includes standing for the American flag.

"Pam Kirby","You talked about school choice earlier, there are a lot of candidates out there who say school choice for me, but not for thee. We have to reject those candidates because school choice cannot be reserved for just the few people. We need to empower all parents with the right to choose the educational systems for their children. And more importantly, we need to empower them with the means to execute against that choice. And when we have done that, we will have truly freed all students from their zip codes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","01:02:19"

But I just wanted to bring a couple of things from down South, from Tucson, and bring it to the table as to what the Latino community is feeling and what it’s missing. And what it’s missing is more of your leadership, and Latinos are conservative they just don’t know it. I’ll make it really quick. I don’t want to drag on too long here, but ever since you were elected, it’s been easier and easier and easier to recruit Latinos from all over the state.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","01:05:52"

It is a critical time right now for our kids, for our family, and for our children. And I’m going to give you just one personal tale where I had my kids in the car, we pulled over to the side of the street, we were playing Pokemon GO, and we got pulled over by a police officer. And I told everybody, “Relax. These are the good guys.” Police officer shows up says, “Hey, what’s going on?

"Monica Yellin","Good afternoon. We welcome new citizens who love our people and share our values. [inaudible 01:09:40] speech, 2017. Immigrants enrich this country, and I want them to come in big numbers. The State of the Union, 2019. Mr. President, these words will resonate with me forever. Thank you so much for what you do for the Latino community, for securing our borders, for supporting legal immigration, and for your efforts again, child exploitation and for … being so successful fighting human trafficking. You heard us loud and clear, and you know that we want safer communities. My name is Monica Yellin. I was born in Bogota, Colombia. I came to this country in 1998 with a J-1 work visa, just one piece of luggage, and $300. In 2005, I proudly became a citizen of this country. And right after my naturalization ceremony in Brooklyn, New York, I drove as fast as I could to the New York Board of Elections and I registered to vote. I live in Port Washington, a little town on the North shores of Long Island. My husband is here and he’s a Jewish American New Yorker from New Rochelle, who is glowing, full of excitement and wanted me to thank you for standing for Israel.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-hosts-latinos-for-trump-event-transcript-september-14","Donald Trump Hosts Latinos for Trump Event Transcript September 14","01:09:33"

"Monica Yellin","Thanks to your administration policies, Latino families have more money in their pockets because of the double child credit and the standard deduction. The double standard deductions. Furthermore, small and medium businesses are grateful for your tax cuts and the deregulations. Back in 2019 in September, we had the lowest Latino unemployment rate, which was 3.9%. And in 2018, more than 362,000 Latinos bought homes around the country. Thank you, Mr. President. Twenty-one years ago, when I arrive alone in this country, I could have never imagined the diverse and blessings in the journey that was ahead of me. From getting a master’s degree translating at night at home, to becoming a chairwoman of a large insurance industry committee in the East Coast, to director of strategic initiatives, to being elected by vote to a county board, to be appointed as one of the members of commission of domestic violence, to serving my community every day, and most important to be here today with the President of United States of America.
