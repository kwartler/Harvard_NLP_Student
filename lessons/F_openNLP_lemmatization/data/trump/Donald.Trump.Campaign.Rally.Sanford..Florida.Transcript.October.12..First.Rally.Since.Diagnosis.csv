"Donald Trump","Hello everybody. Hello Orlando. Hello Sanford. It’s great to be with you. Thank you. It’s great to be back. That’s a lot of people. Our competitor sleepy Joe, he had a rally today and practically nobody showed up. I don’t know what’s going on. Sleepy Joe. But it’s great to be back in my home state, Florida to make my official return to the campaign trail. I am so energized by your prayers and humbled by your support. We’ve had such incredible support and here we are. Here we are. But we’re going to finish. We’re going to make this country greater than ever before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","00:00"
"Donald Trump","Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. We’ve made tremendous progress. If you look at what we’re doing with therapeutics and frankly cures, we’ve made tremendous progress. And I said to my people, we are going to take whatever the hell they gave me and we’re going to distribute it around to hospitals and everyone’s going to have the same damn thing. We’ve all endured a lot together. And we are doing better by far than we ever did in 2016. The enthusiasm’s greater. The spirit is greater. We’re going to have, if it’s possible, an even greater and more important victory than we had just four years ago. And nobody ever said this fight was not going to be a hard one, but we will make it like you’ve never seen before. We are more successful now than we’ve ever been before. Our military is rebuilt.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","01:34"
"Donald Trump","Take a look at what’s going on with our economy. I hate to say to the fake news, we’re about to hit another stock market record, 401Ks. Sleepy Joe Biden. Not a nice guy, by the way. I have to be honest. He’s not a nice guy. People say, “Oh, he’s such a nice guy.” He had a very bad day today. He had a very bad day. You saw what happened. If I ever had a day like he had today, they’d say it’s over. It’s over. No Biden had a bad day. He forgot Mitt Romney’s name. He didn’t know what state he was in. And he said today he’s a proud Democrat running for the US Senate. No you can’t. Can’t do it. It’s the second time. Can you imagine if I did that? “It’s great to be with you. It’s great to be a wonderful developer from New York.” They’d say he’s out of here. Get him out. No, Biden had a bad day. He’s got a lot of bad days coming. Look, look, we can’t play games. The one thing I know for sure, President Xi of China did us no favor. President Putin of Russia, you’re looking around. Kim Jong-un, whatever happened to the war we were supposed to be in with Kim Jong-un. Kim Jong-un, they’re 100% sharp. We have somebody running who’s not 100%. He’s not 80%. He’s not 60%. We can’t have this as a country. We can’t have it. Joe Biden is also owned by the radical globalists, the wealthy donors, the big money special interests who shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in this ridiculous, endless wars. Set of endless wars that we’ve been in for a long time. 19 years, they’re all coming back home. You know that, right?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","02:39"
"Donald Trump","They’re all coming back home. Our great warriors, our great soldiers. The corrupt political class is desperate to regain their power by any means necessary. We’re the one standing in their way. We’re the one standing up for the American worker, the American family, and for the American dream. And that’s what we’re doing on this beautiful evening. This beautiful evening in Florida. Oh do I like Florida. Did we win Florida last time? Was that beautiful?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","04:44"
"Donald Trump","Everything I hear, we’re winning by a lot. Then you turn on the fake news. They say, “The polls are tied in Florida.” I don’t get it. I don’t. We heard the same thing last year. Remember? Four years ago, we heard the same thing. ” We’re going to lose Florida,” they said four years ago, “by five points.” They called that thing so early in the evening and we won by a lot. And we’re winning by a lot more now than we were four years ago.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","05:17"
"Donald Trump","22 days from now, we’re going to win this state. We’re going to win four more years in the White House. We’re going to make our country greater than it has ever been before. Thank you, man. Thank you. This is the most important election in the history of our country. And I used to say it in 2016. I’m sorry, at the time I thought it was. These people are crazy. We have to win. Most important we’ve ever had. Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control to the socialists, the Marxists and the left-wing extremists. And you know that. And he’s got no strength left. He’s got no power left. He’s got nothing going.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","05:46"
"Donald Trump","If he wins, the radical left will be running the country and they’re addicted to power and God help us if they ever got it, because we would never have the same country again. And you couldn’t make a comeback. You don’t make comebacks from where they’d take us. If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician, it’s because frankly, I’m not a politician. I’m embarrassed by the throne. And if I don’t always play by the rules of Washington establishment, it’s because I was elected to fight for you and I fight harder than anybody has ever fought for you. And I had a very nice life before this, I will tell you. And a lot easier. But I love this, that I would have never, ever change because we are doing more for this country than any administration has ever done despite the witch hunts and the phony stuff that we caught them on now. We caught them cold and we’ll see what happens with that. Just watch, stay tuned.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","06:53"
"Donald Trump","Right now I’m fighting to make sure we eradicate the virus, rebuild the economy and save our country from the radical left. We’re hitting record stock market numbers, record 401Ks, record stocks, record job numbers. Don’t blow it. Don’t blow it. Sleepy Joe wants to quadruple your taxes. He wants to quadruple. How about where he gets caught again, he said, “Oh no, we’re not going to give a tax increase, but we’re going to terminate all of the Trump tax cuts.” Well, that’s $2,000 plus child tax credits, plus all of the other things, you’re talking about $6,000, $7,000, $8,000 a year. I don’t think Florida is going to be paying that per family. And if you add energy into that, we have energy at all time low. We’re energy independent. Nobody ever thought that was going to happen. And when you are paying less than $2 at the pump like you are, nobody ever thought you’d see those days again. And those days are here for a long time if we’re smart. We’ve been beating China. We’ve been beating everybody. Until the plague came in, we were teaching China like they’ve never been taught before and they know it. And they’ve told me that and they never thought it could happen. And we’re very soon going to be doing it again. We achieved all of this despite the fact that we caught them cold. They were spying on our campaign. It’s our campaign. It’s our campaign, not my campaign.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","08:02"
"Donald Trump","There was spying on our campaign and illegally trying to take down a very, very straightforward and legally sworn in administration. We were sworn in. They tried before the fact, they tried after the fact. We were an admin… And then they say, “We want to know if you will agree with a friendly transfer of power.” For four years, they’ve been trying to get us out of office. Four years they’ve been trying to get us out, but we’ll take care of it all after the election. We caught them cold. We caught them cold. Bad people, crooked Hillary.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","09:37"
"Donald Trump","And by the way, Obama and Biden knew everything that was happening, okay? Just in case you had any question. We’ll take care of it after the election. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists, but that gives you another reason to go out and vote. We got to get in. Because we don’t, they’ll just sweep it under the rug. Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists will kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, dissolve your borders. You know that? Release criminal aliens, confiscate your guns. No more Second Amendment, get used to it. Destroy your suburbs and drive God from the public square. That’s what’s going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","10:19"
"Donald Trump","You saw in the pledge of allegiance during the Democrat National Convention. They took the word God out twice. They said, “Oh, we made a mistake. Excuse me.” And then it happened a second time. We said, “Well, I guess that wasn’t a mistake, right?” Biden even refuses to answer questions on the packing of the Supreme Court. Nobody even thought of that for many, many, many decades. And that’s what they want to do. They can’t get there legitimately. So they’re said, “That’s all right. We’ll just pack the court. We’ll put a lot of super lefties on the court and we’ll have a whole different country.” Nope. Not going to happen that way. We’re not going to let it happen. You got to get out and vote.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","11:04"
"Donald Trump","A lot of people said that I was elected because of the Supreme Court, because I said I’m going to put great conservative, constitutionalists, great judges on the Supreme Court. I don’t know if it’s true. But if it is true, it’s more true now than it was four years ago. And you got to get out and vote because they’re going to destroy our country and they’re going to destroy our US Supreme Court, and we can’t let that happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","11:44"
"Donald Trump","But who would have thought? We’re on number three. Other presidents have never had any. They’ve never had any. We’re at three already, three and a half years. And I will say this, I will say this. It’s driving them crazy. It’s driving them crazy. And Amy is fantastic. A great intellect, a great scholar. I think she’s going to be a fantastic US Supreme Court Justice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","12:10"
"Donald Trump","As America saw earlier today in Amy’s opening statement in the Senate, Judge Barrett, a brilliant scholar who will defend our laws, our rights, our freedom, and our constitution like very few people would have the capability of doing. The radical left is hell bent on destroying everything we love and cherish. They’re enraged and unhinged out of vengeance and nobody can believe what they’re doing and where they’re going, but we understand it. We understand their canceled culture. We’re not letting them cancel culture us at all. We’re proud of our country and we’re proud of our heritage.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","12:42"
"Donald Trump","They want to punish the middle-class, expunge every last trace of traditional values and replace the American dream with a socialist nightmare, and that’s what it is. They want to turn America into communist Cuba or socialist Venezuela, and ruin the lives of Hispanic Americans and all Americans. And I want to thank the Hispanic Americans down in Florida. You have been so incredible to Trump. Biden’s agenda would be a catastrophe for Florida seniors. And by the way, Biden was a big lover of Castro. You do know that, right? And you know the deal that I broke, you saw that? Right as I came into office, Obama gave the whole planet away to Castro. And I said, “No, thank you. We’re not doing that.” That’s why we just got the Bay of Pigs award from the Cuban Americans, thank you very much. And a lot of them are here. Thank you all very much. Bay of Pigs. For years, Biden tried to cut Social Security and Medicare. You know all about that. Now Biden is pledging mass amnesty and federal healthcare for illegal aliens. Now, we all have a heart and we all want to take care of people. But what you’re doing is you’re telling millions of people to pour up into our country. We’re going to give you education. We’re going to give you healthcare. We’re going to give you everything. We can’t do it. We can’t afford it. We can’t take care of our own people. We have to take care of our people first. And if they let that happen, you would be decimating Medicare and destroying your Social Security.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","13:28"
"Donald Trump","While I’m president, no one will touch your Medicare. No one will touch or hurt in any way, shape or form your Social Security. With your vote I will finish building the strongest economy the world has ever seen and we were there. Last year was the greatest year in the history of the State of Florida. And I have to say, it was practically that way for almost every state in the union. But it was Florida’s best year. The year coming is going to be, and you’re going to see a great third quarter set of numbers coming out very soon just before the election. So I’m putting myself on the spot. The third quarter numbers are going to be record setting phenomenal numbers. Next year is going to be the best year we’ve ever had economically.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","15:13"
"Donald Trump","But as I’ve done from the beginning, I will keep every promise and I will always put America first. You haven’t heard that, right? You haven’t heard that from other people. Under my leadership, we’re delivering a safe vaccine and a rapid recovery like nobody could even believe. And if you look at our upward path, no country in the world has recovered the way we’ve recovered economically or otherwise, not even close. And if you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life, that’s all we want. We want a normal life. We’ll fully resume. And the Florida tourism and hospitality industries that I know so well, will reach historic new highs. Highs like they’ve never reached before. Biden would terminate our recovery. Delay the vaccine, prolong the pandemic and annihilate Florida’s economy with a draconian unscientific lockdown.

"Donald Trump","… his economy with a draconian, unscientific lockdown. That’s what he wants to do, lock it down. Lock it down, everybody. And you know what? If you don’t feel good about going out, stay, relax, stay. You know the risk groups, you know the older people. See, fortunately, I’m not an old person.

"Donald Trump","I’m in such great shape. I said that the other day. I said, “Well, I’m very young, and I’m in great shape, perfect shape.” And they said, “Donald Trump misrepresented today, again. He said he was in great shape, that he’s very young.” These people are the sickest of them all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","17:21"
"Donald Trump","But the World Health Organization, did you see what happened? They just came out a little while ago, and they admitted the Donald Trump was right. The lockdowns are doing tremendous damage to these Democrat-run states, where they’re locked out, sealed up. Suicide rates, drug rates, alcoholism, deaths by so many different forms. You can’t do that. And I want to just congratulate the governor and everybody in Florida. You’re open and open for business and doing great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","17:46"
"Donald Trump","And we got to remember, I said it right at the beginning, the cure cannot be worse than the problem itself. The cure can not be worse, but if you don’t feel good about it, if you want to stay, stay, relax, stay. But if you want to get out there, get out. One thing with me, the nice part, I went through it. Now they say I’m immune. I feel so powerful. I will walk into that audience. I’ll walk in there, I’ll kiss everyone in that audience. I’ll kiss the guys and the beautiful women, and everybody.

"Donald Trump","No, but there is something nice. I don’t have to be locked up in my basement, and I wouldn’t allow that to happen anyway. I wouldn’t allow it to happen. When you’re the president, you can’t lock yourself in a basement and say, “I’m not going to bother with the world.” You got to get out, and it’s risky. It’s risky, but you got to get out. But it does give you a good feeling when you can beat something, and now they say you’re immune. I don’t know for how long. Some people say for life. Some people say for four months. I mean, every time I think about it, every time I hear them, it gets shorter and shorter and shorter, because they want it to be as bad as possible.

We’re 90% better now than we were six, seven months ago, in terms of a cure for people that get really sick, 90%. It’s incredible what’s happened. And with children is 99.9%, you’re going to be okay. You’re going to be okay. 99. 9. They have a little better immune systems, we just learned that, better than you have, better than we all have.

Right? And his own person, his chief of staff, said that it was a disaster the way they ran it. A much less lethal problem, but a disaster, the way they ran it, a total catastrophe. It was so bad. It was so bad. And then he says, “I’m going to tell him what to do. But when I locked down China, he thought it was a terrible thing. He called me xenophobic when I locked down China, which was in January, months earlier than what he said.

We’re bringing it all the way back, taking our jobs away from China. We’re bringing it back from China. I’ll reverse. Biden’s catastrophic decision. We’ll bring it all back.

We’ve also directed the FBI to immediately investigate the destruction of the Teddy Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln statues in Portland and to prosecute the offenders to the fullest extent of federal law. Biden supporters are causing mayhem in the streets. If he wins, there will be nothing but bedlam all over the place, but he’s not going to win. He may be the worst presidential candidate in history, and I got him, I got him. It actually puts more pressure on you. If you ran against a great candidate, there’s actually less pressure.

"Donald Trump","No, we want to keep our country great. We’re bringing it to a level that it’s never been. Our military has equipment the likes of which nobody has ever seen, no country has ever seen, all made in the USA, rockets, missiles, tanks, ships, the likes of which, jet fighters, bombers, tankers, the likes of which no country has ever seen before.

"Donald Trump","Right? [inaudible 00:28:07]. Did a great job. But it’s because Biden and Harris, that’s another great one. There was nobody so mean to Biden than her, nobody. And so, brilliantly, I said he can’t pick her, because nobody treated him as badly. Although I will say this, had Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren got out prior to Super Tuesday, we would have had Bernie instead. But I’d rather have Biden, because he’s now alienated the left. He’s alienated the right. Nobody knows what the hell he stands for.

"Donald Trump","He goes to Pennsylvania. For a year-and-a-half, he’s against fracking. The day he gets the nomination, through a little luck, because she didn’t get out. So she took all of Bernie’s votes, right? But following day, he said, “I’m in favor of fracking.” But he’s not. And it doesn’t matter, because the radical left will never let Pennsylvania and Texas and Oklahoma and North Dakota and Ohio, never let them frack.

"Donald Trump","But can you imagine? And the press, which is fake and corrupt, the press never said … Have you ever heard him asked? No. Have you ever heard him asked once, “Well, wait a minute. For one year, you said there will be no fracking.” And he said it strongly, right? You know, “Read my lips.” Right? To use an old expression, “Read my lips, there will be no fracking.” That didn’t work out too well. So now he goes, and he says there will be fracking. Not once have I heard the question. Not once have I asked why Hunter was able to take $3.5 million from the wife of the mayor of Moscow. Not once have I heard these frauds back there. Not once have I heard the fake news. Not once have I heard him say, “A billion dollars. If you don’t change that prosecutor, you’re not getting the billion dollars.” And then he goes, “Whoa, the prosecutor was changed.” The prosecutor against his son. Not once have I heard them talking about that question.

So I proudly received the endorsements of the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Troopers Coalition, the International Union of Police Associations, the National Latino Police Officers Association, the Florida police chiefs and all of these incredible organizations, plus all over the country. And when I asked him, “Name one organization, give me one organization.” During our debate, where he was saved by the moderator about four times, he couldn’t answer it.

Nobody knows how smart. Don’t tell too many people. He likes to catch you by surprise. But he’s a great, great guy, and he’s been a great friend. I said, “All right, I’ll endorse you.” I endorsed him, and the rest … he went like a rocket ship, and he handled the pressure. And his wife, Casey, is better than him.

In other cases, they just said, “No, we’re voting for Trump.” I said, “Why are you doing that?” “We have no choice.” I said, “You’re right, you’re right.” But nobody’s been better to law enforcement than I have. You know when I first came in, we gave away hundreds of millions of dollars of military equipment that was in storage. Wasn’t doing anybody any good, it was collecting dust, probably paying rent all over the place. That’s probably why they had it, come to think of it. But look how far that crowd goes back.

The other guy gets out there and he’s … they work at work and work and 30 people show up. They put them in those crazy circles, right? They only have the circles because that’s the only way they can fill up the room, it’s true. But that’s a fantastic group of people, thank you. Same thing over here. I wish the fake news would turn the cameras. For a long time, I didn’t think the cameras moved that way, but then anytime there was a little sign of problems, they could twist around like a pretzel and I realized they could. But they don’t like to show those crowds, but that is a massive amount. I don’t know how many people are here, but you got a lot. I want to thank you.

But we take care of the Panhandle and we’re doing it at a level that’s never been done before. And I’ve done it, I think I can say right from the beginning, right? I tell the story about Ron DeSantis. He came to see me, he just became governor. “We had a hurricane. Sir, thank you very much for the money you send to the Panhandle in Florida. I appreciate it.” “Good, Ron, good. I hope it’s enough. Good, spend it well.” I get a call like three days later. “Sir, could I see you?” Now, I’m in Washington. I say, “You don’t have to come up, tell me.” “No, no, no, it’s very important. Sir,” comes into the oval office, “Sir, could we have an extra $500 million?” I said, “Ron, will it ever end, Ron?” And one thing I found out, it never ends for the Panhandle and for Ron, but we take care of it, right, Ron? We take care of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","36:20"

Last month they approved a major disaster declaration for the state of Florida. And I’ll be with you through every step of the rebuilding and you’ll be hit with others. The one thing we know about Florida, you’re very good at this stuff. You get hit by hurricanes and you rebuild, and you rebuild fast, and it’s incredible. I’ve watched, I’ve watched and you don’t want much help either. You’re proud people, you’re incredible people. You put it back together. But we’re there for you all the way.

"Donald Trump","We spent the last four years reversing the damage Biden has inflicted over the last 47 years with that ridiculous, dumb thought NAFTA, T.P.P., and China’s entry into the World Trade Organization, a disaster for our country. China is considered a developing nation. I stopped that. China’s considered a develop … in other words, China, they’re so wonderful they’re developing, isn’t that nice? Now by being a developing nation, they get much more benefits than a nation that’s not a developing. So I said, “Well, we’re a developing nation too, if they’re a developing nation.” And we just won, you know this, we just won seven and a half billion dollars from the World Trade Organization. And from the World Health Organization, I took us out. They said, “Why did you do that?” I said, “Number one, they were wrong on everything.” Although, they corrected themselves today and they said I was right for the lockdowns. But I said, “Number two, why are we paying 500 million a year? And China, which has one point four billion people is paying 39 million a year, explain that?” They couldn’t explain, it was very hard to explain. So I took us out for that and other reasons, okay. So we’ll see what happens with that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","38:03"
"Donald Trump","But these are the deals. I could go over hundreds of different things with you and just common sense. I mean, common sense, what we do. Think of it, World Health Organization, we spend … we have 325 million people, we spend $500 million. China spends $39 million and China dominates them. I said, “Doesn’t work that way anymore, doesn’t work that way anymore.” They’ll take us back in so fast at much less money. For decades, our politicians spend trillions and trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars and defending foreign borders. But now we are finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, and our factory, and our troops back home to the U.S.A. But those dismal days of betrayal and that’s what we were, we were betrayed by our own politicians, whether it was on purpose, or that they were just plain stupid. We’ll come back with unprecedented force if Washington Democrats are allowed to take control again, we can’t let it happen. You have got to get out and vote.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","39:22"
"Donald Trump","Sleepy Joe Biden, and it wasn’t him, it’s the people that control him. He’s controlled totally. Has put forward the most radical platform in American history, including a plan to eliminate U.S. borders. Oh, that’s wonderful, where’s our border? We don’t have one, just come in, everybody come on in, come on in everybody. If you’re a murderer, if you’re a rapist, if you’re very, very sick with a disease that can spread all over, just come on in. We’re up to almost 400 miles of wall, nobody talks about that anymore. And we now have the tightest, safest border in our country’s history, but we’re up to almost 400 miles, it’ll be finished very soon. And it’s top of the line. It’s exactly what border patrol wanted. But by implementing nationwide catch and release, imposing deadly sanctuary cities nationwide, nationwide, they want sanctuary cities, that’s what they want. I don’t even think … I’ll tell you, I know a lot of people in California, they don’t want sanctuary cities. It’s like the politicians want it. I don’t think the people want it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","40:54"
"Donald Trump","But they want to suspend all removals of illegals out of our country, whether they’re murderers, rapists, thugs, bank robbers, they don’t care. They want to suspend it. You almost say, where the hell are they coming from? Where does it even … where does the thought process come? It’s demented. It would mean the total nullification of all U.S. borders, overwhelming every city and town in America, including this wonderful place that we all love very much. Under my leadership, we achieved the most secure border in U.S. history and we’re finishing that wall. It’s going to be finished and so beautiful, wait’ll you see that. Wait’ll see that. A few more months. We’re doing 10 miles a day. And by the way, Mexico is paying, they hate to say it. Mexico is paying for it. And Mexico’s been great. Mexico has 27,000 of their soldiers on our border. And I said, you have to do that, otherwise we’re going to have to charge you tariffs because we’re not going to stand for it. When people are pouring into our … and we have the worst laws because Congress over the years has made it so weak.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","41:59"
"Donald Trump","If you’re a soldier and you talk rudely to somebody, they ended up giving you the electric chair, okay? It’s so horrible. Mexico has been great. 27,000 soldiers we have, see, 27. Now the electric chair comment, they’ll put that, “He’s exaggerating. He shouldn’t do that.” They are sick people. But it is true, we have 27,000 Mexican soldiers guarding our border and you know what, they don’t play games. They don’t let them through. And if they do let them through, we get very angry with Mexico. So Mexico’s been great. The president of Mexico’s been great. We’re putting a border tax on for cars and trucks that go across. It will much more than pay for our wall, starting soon. Remember when the old days we used to say, we’ll build the wall, everybody thought there was no way. It’s one of the largest projects in the history of our country, because you’re talking about a lot of miles, 540 miles. And then we may even add some more into other areas where you probably, you have natural barriers like mountains and rivers, and a lot of other pretty tough areas. But we may even add some more. We’re doing so great with it, 10 miles a day.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","43:09"

One thing with the Army Corps, they may build it a little expensive, but you can’t rip that sucker down and it never [inaudible 00:00:44:30]. That’ll never come down. We ended the catch and release ridiculous program where you catch somebody, you take their name, and then you release them. And you say, come back in three years to a court case. And nobody ever comes back, except for the really dumb ones, they come back on occasion. But nobody ever comes back, they’re in our country. They could be murderers and they could be all sorts of problems and we’re not having that. We ended it. We stopped asylum fraud and we’ve deported 20,000 gang members, including MS-13. Brought them back to their country. We brought them back to their country.

"Donald Trump","And outside of poorly run Democrat states and cities, you don’t have crime in this country. Our country is doing fantastically. And I call up governors in Portland, and I call up from the state and I call up the governor, as an example, Oregon. I say, “We’d love to send some people to help you out with Oregon and to help you out with Portland. We’ll solve the problem in a half an hour, like we did in Minnesota with Minneapolis. We’ll solve the problem quickly.” Remember Minneapolis was burning down, day after day and I’d call, let us come in, let us come in. Anyway, they finally came in. How long did it take? About a half an hour. Remember the beautiful scene, they lined up. They weren’t socially distanced, but that’s okay. They lined up, then another line, another line. Then they just walk forward and that was the end of that. And I think we’re going to win the state of Minnesota because of it, I think.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","45:18"
"Donald Trump","Hasn’t been won since 1972, but it’s looking like we’re going to win Minnesota because of it because nobody, I mean what they did. But I give the governor credit, at least, even though it was too long, he let us in. Oregon, we have to send in the troops. We will solve that problem in 30 minutes. We sent in the U.S. Marshals. Recently, when the man, this horrible human being shot somebody and killed them in the middle of the street. Two days went by, three days went by, I said, “Why hasn’t he been arrested?” We sent in the U.S Marshals. In 15 minutes it was all over, 15 minutes. Be so easy to do. I mean, can you imagine these people for years and years, it’s been anarchy in Portland, for years and years. But not for the Republicans. This is why you cannot have the Democrats and that whole philosophy, that whole craziness, you can not have them involved in running your country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","46:17"
"Donald Trump","We invested two point five trillion dollars in the U.S. military, including funding to save Tyndall Air Force Base, because who knows Tyndall. Who is … well, not that big a group. That’s not like a big group. I can tell you if you were in the Panhandle, you’d be saying, thank you very much. It was wiped out by the hurricane and Ron called, and a number of people called, and Marco called, Rick Scott called, they all called. They wanted to save Tyndall and we did it. And now it’s brand new, gorgeous, and really moving along well, right? We did a good job there, I think so. We launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years called Space Force, very [important 00:48:02].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","47:13"
"Donald Trump","For an administration, if you think of it, so not for 75 years, we’ve created a new force, right? The Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines. So think of it, Coast Guard. And now we just created a new force, first time at 75 years, if I did nothing but that, that’s a big deal. And that’s peanuts, that’s peanuts. Because we built the greatest economy in history. We cut taxes more than any other president by far in history. We cut regulations, which I think is maybe just as important as the taxes, that’s why our businesses are roaring back. We’ve done things that nobody else has done, nobody else has. And these people back here, they don’t even challenge me on it, which is shocking. Usually you think they’d challenge you, even if they’re wrong. I also brought back NASA, the greatest space center, again, in the world. And we passed V.A. Choice and V.A.

"Donald Trump","And we just got a 91% approval rating, Ron. 91% approval rating by the vets on the way we’re running it, never happened before. That’s never happened before, Rick, never happened before. We killed the leader of ISIS who was trying to reform ISIS because we blew it into oblivion. We killed al-Baghdadi, they were looking for him for years and years and years. Guess who got him? We took out the world’s number one terrorist and the mass murder of American troops and many, many people all over the world, Qasem Soleimani, he’s dead, gone. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous Iran Nuclear Deal, which was a catastrophe. President Obama give us $150 billion and we’ll give you nothing. Give us one point eight billion in green, in cash. He gave him one point eight billion in cash. That’s when I realized how powerful the presidency is, when you could do that. What a horrible deal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","49:08"
"Donald Trump","But we broke the deal, and I’ll tell you probably the first call I’ll get after we win the election will be from Iran dying to make a deal because they’re down 28% GDP, nobody’s ever heard of a thing like that. That’ll be the first call I get. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. I kept my promise, recognized the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. And every president promised to do it. Every president said they were going to do that for many, many decades. They all were going to do that. Nobody did it because once they got in office, there was a lot of pressure on you not to do it. I could tell you, I was called by every foreign leader, “Please don’t do it. Please don’t do-”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","50:14"
"Donald Trump","Not to do it. I can tell you I was called by every foreign leader. Please don’t do it. Please don’t do it. I tell the story. I said, listen, tell them, I’ll call them back in a couple of days. Then, I did it. I called him back. Hey, what’s up?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","51:03"
"Donald Trump","I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years they’ve been working on that. They’ve been working on that for 52 years. They couldn’t get anything. Every year, people would fly in, stay, wine, dine, have a good time and leave. Nothing would happen. 52 years. I got it done in one day. Instead of these endless wars, we’re forging peace in the Middle East and peace without blood all over the sand, and you see what’s happening. In fact, a point that they didn’t report, I’ve been, I guess three or four, maybe now, Nobel Peace Prizes. Can you believe it? Four, three. I told a story. I told my wife. Oh, we’re going to have a great time. We’re going to watch television. I just got nominated for the Nobel Prize. And then I turned on the fake news. Story after story. They talk about your weather in the panhandle run. They talk about this. Story after story. No mention. Remember, when Obama got it right at the beginning and he didn’t even know why he got it? It was the biggest story you’ve ever seen. The last administration made a pathetic one-sided deal with the Castro dictatorship that betrayed the Cuban people and enriched the communist regime. They’re not enriched any longer. My opponent stands with socialists and communists. He wants to give everything away to Cuba. He wants to give it away to Nicaragua and Venezuela, not going to happen, not going to happen, not going to happen. I stand with the people of Cuba and Nicaragua and Venezuela in their righteous struggle for freedom.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","51:13"
"Donald Trump","The last administration also negotiated the terrible Obama-Biden Santos steel with Colombian drug cartels. They surrendered the narco terrorists. They surrendered totally gave up to him and that caused illicit drugs and illicit drugs all over this country. Joe Biden even received the endorsement of Colombian socialists, Gustavo Petro, a former member of the M19 Guerrilla organization, and he took it, because you know why, he didn’t know who the hell it was. He said, I’ll take it. I’ll take whoever. And I said, no, he’s a bad guy, Joe. He’s actually a bad guy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","53:05"
"Donald Trump","Under my administration, we worked with Colombian officials to seize or disrupt 227 metric tons of poisonous narcotics since April, and we’re doing fantastically in terms of bringing it down, 19% reduction. My heart will always be with the Colombian people and the people from Cuba and the people from Venezuela and Nicaragua and all of the people that are so unfairly treated, and you’ll see a lot of great things happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","53:42"
"Donald Trump","I did more in 47 months than Joe Biden did in 47 years. And now he’s pushing the most far left agenda ever foot forward by a Presidential nominee or candidate. The Biden Plan would destroy Social Security and destroy protections for pre-existing conditions. You’re going to have nothing left, this crazy new Green New Deal. The Green New Deal. I mean, what’s that all about? Biden’s running mate sponsored The Green New Deal and the Socialist Healthcare takeover. You’re going to have Socialist Healthcare. You don’t feel well? Okay. Go to the hospital. Stay there for about four weeks. They’ll shut down american energy, shut down fracking and outlaw the private health insurance plans of over 180 million Americans who love those plans.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","54:13"
"Donald Trump","Biden vowed to terminate our travel bans on jihadist regions and surge refugee admissions. He agreed to this with crazy Bernie Sanders. He’s going to surge admissions into our country by agreed number 700%. No, thank you. Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism, and I don’t like to speak too loud, but we’re not doing too badly, are we?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","55:04"
"Donald Trump","He’ll ban school choice. He’ll ban charter schools and he’ll ban Florida opportunity scholarships, which is a big deal, a big deal. He wants to put him out of business run. In a second term, I’ll provide school choice to every parent in America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","55:32"
"Donald Trump","A vote for Republicans is a vote for safe communities, great jobs, and a limitless future for all Americans. And I just have to say in conclusion, over the next four years, we will make America into the manufacturing superpower of the world. And we will end our reliance on China once and for all. It’s ending. We will hire more police, increase penalties for assaults on law enforcement, and we will ban deadly sanctuary cities, which you’re already doing. We will uphold religious liberty, free speech and the right to keep and bear arms, your second Amendment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","55:52"
"Donald Trump","We will strike down terrorists who threaten our citizens, and we will keep America out of these ridiculous, horrible and very, very stupid foreign wars against countries that you’ve never even heard of. We will maintain America’s unrivaled military might, and we will ensure peace through strength. We will end surprise medical billing, require price transparency. It’s already signed and it takes place on January 1st, and further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by 50, 60, 70, and even 80%.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","56:36"
"Donald Trump","We will strongly protect Medicare and Social Security, and we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions, always. Republicans will always protect. America will land the first woman on the moon, and the United States will be the first nation to land an astronaut on Mars, and it’s going to be very soon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","57:44"
"Donald Trump","We will stop the radical indoctrination of our students and restore patriotic education to our schools. We will teach our children to love our country, to honor our history and always respect our great American flag. And we will live by the timeless words of our national motto, ” in God we trust.” For years, you had a President who apologized for America. Now, you have a President who is standing up for America and standing up for the great people of Florida.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","58:10"
"Donald Trump","So, get out there and vote. Send in your absentee ballot if you’ve requested one. Be very careful, a lot of shenanigans going on. You see what’s happening. Every day you’re reading it. In person early voting begins next week. So, get your friends, get your family, get your neighbors and get out and vote. You have no choice. You have to do it. True.

"Donald Trump","We’re going to win Florida big. We’re going to win a lot of states big. We’re leading in Arizona. We’re leading in Nevada. We think we’re leading in Pennsylvania. We’re leading in North Carolina. We’re leading all over the place. We got to have this be a big win. From Tampa to Tallahassee, from Pensacola to Miami, and from Jacksonville to right here in Sanford, we stand on the shoulders of Florida Patriots who gave their blood, sweat, and tears for this beloved nation. We stand on the shoulders of American heroes across the oceans, blaze the trails, settle the continent, tame the wilderness, lay down the railroads, dug out the Panama Canal, raised up the skyscrapers, won two world wars, defeated fascism and communism, and from here in this beautiful state, landed our brave American astronauts on the face of the moon.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-campaign-rally-sanford-florida-transcript-october-12-first-rally-since-diagnosis","Donald Trump Campaign Rally Sanford, Florida Transcript October 12: First Rally Since Diagnosis","59:44"

Proud citizens like you help build this country and together we are taking back our country. We’re returning power to you, the American people. With your help, your devotion and your drive, we are going to keep on working. We are going to keep on fighting and we are going to keep on winning, winning, winning. And when Ron DeSantis comes to my office in Washington, the magnificent oval office, and he says to me, sir, sir, the people of Florida, they’ve won too much. They’re getting tired of winning. I’m going to look at him. I’m going to say Mr. Governor, go back and tell them, don’t worry about it. You’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. That’s what they want to do. We’re going to keep on winning, winning, winning. Because we’re one movement, one people, one family, and one glorious nation under God, and together with the incredible people of Florida, we have made America wealthy again. We have made America strong again. We have made America proud again, and we will make America safe again, and we will make America great again. Thank you, Florida. Thank you very much.
