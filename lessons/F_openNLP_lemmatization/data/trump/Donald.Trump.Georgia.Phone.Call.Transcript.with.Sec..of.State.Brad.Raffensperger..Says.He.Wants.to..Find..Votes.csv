"Mark Meadows","Mr. President, everyone is on the line. And just so this is Mark Meadows, the chief of staff. Just so we all are aware. On the line is secretary of state, and two other individuals. Jordan and Mr. Germany with him. You also have the attorneys that represent the president, Kurt and Alex and Cleta Mitchell, who is not the attorney of record but has been involved, myself and then the president. So Mr. President, I’ll turn it over to you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","00:00"
"President Trump","Okay, thank you very much. Hello Brad and Ryan and everybody. We appreciate the time and the call. So we’ve spent a lot of time on this and if we could just go over some of the numbers, I think it’s pretty clear that we won. We won very substantially in Georgia. You even see it by rally size, frankly. We’d be getting 25-30,000 people a rally and the competition would get less than 100 people. And it never made sense. But we have a number of things. We have at least 2 or 3, anywhere from 250-300,000 ballots were dropped mysteriously into the rolls. Much of that had to do with Fulton County, which hasn’t been checked. We think that if you check the signatures, a real check of the signatures going back in Fulton County, you’ll find at least a couple of hundred thousand of forged signatures of people who have been forged. And we are quite sure that’s going to happen.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","00:38"
"President Trump","Another tremendous number. We’re going to have an accurate number over the next two days with certified accountants, but an accurate number will be given. But it’s in the fifties of thousands and that’s people that went to vote and they were told they can’t vote because they’ve already been voted for. And it’s a very sad thing. They walked out complaining, but the number is large we’ll have it for you, but it’s much more than the number of 11,779. The current margin is only 11,779. Brad, I think you agree with that, right? That’s something, I think, at least that’s a number that everyone agrees on. But that’s the difference in the votes. But we had hundreds of thousands of ballots that were able to… Actually, we’ll get you a pretty accurate number.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","01:42"
"President Trump","You don’t need much of a number because the number that in theory I lost by, the margin would be 11,779. But you also have a substantial numbers of people, thousands and thousands who went to the voting place on November 3, were told they couldn’t vote, were told they couldn’t vote because a ballot had been put on their name. And you know that’s very, very, very, very sad. We had, I believe it’s about 4,502 voters who voted but who weren’t on the voter registration list. So it’s 4,502 who voted but they weren’t on the voter registration roll which they had to be. You had 18,325 vacant address voters. The address was vacant and they’re not allowed to be counted. That’s 18,325. A smaller number, you had 904 who only voted where they had just a P.O., A post office box number.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","02:43"
"President Trump","And they had a post office box number and that’s not allowed. We had at least 18,000, that’s on tape, we had them counted very painstakingly. 18,000 voters having to do with Ruby Freeman. She’s a vote scammer, a professional vote scammer and hustler Ruby Freeman. That was the tape that’s been shown all over the world that makes everybody look bad, you, me and everybody else, where they got number one, they said very clearly. And it’s been reported that they said there was a major water main break. Everybody fled the area. And then they came back Ruby Freeman and her daughter and a few people. There was no Republican poll Watchers. Actually, there were no Democrat poll Watchers, I guess they were them. But there were no Democrats either and there was no law enforcement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","03:53"
"President Trump","Early in the morning they went to the table with the black robe, the black shield and they pulled out the votes. Those votes were put there a number of hours before the table was put there. I think it was, Brad you would know, it was probably eight hours or seven hours before and then it was stuffed with votes. They weren’t in an official voter box, they were in what looked to be suitcases. But they weren’t in voter boxes. The minimum number it could be because we watched it and they watched it certified in slow motion instant replay if you can believe it, but slow motion and it was magnified many times over and the minimum it was 18,000 ballots, all for Biden.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","04:55"
"President Trump","You had out-of-state voters, they voted in Georgia, but they were from out of state of 4,925. You had absentee ballot sent to a vacant, they were absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses. They had nothing on them about addresses. That’s 2,326. And you had drop boxes, which is very bad. You had drop boxes that were picked up. We have photographs and we have affidavits from many people. I don’t know if you saw the hearings, but you have drop boxes where the box was picked up but not delivered for three days. So all sorts of things could have happened to that box including, putting in the votes that you wanted. So there were many infractions and the bottom line is, many, many times the 11,779 margin that they said we lost by… We had vast, I mean, you have, the state is in turmoil over this, and I know you would like to get to the bottom of it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","05:48"
"President Trump","Although I saw you on television today, and you said that you found nothing wrong. I mean, and I didn’t lose the state, Brad. People have been saying that it was the highest vote ever. There was no way… A lot of the political people said that there’s no way they beat me. And they beat me. They beat me in the… As you know, every single state… We won every state. We won every State House in the country. We held the Senate which is shocking to people, although we’ll see what happens tomorrow or in a few days. And we won the House. And we won Congress, which was supposed to lose 15 seats, and they gained, I think 16 or 17 or something. I think there’s now a difference of five. That was supposed to be a different substantially more.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","07:01"
"President Trump","But politicians in every state, but politicians in Georgia have given affidavits and are going to that there was no way they’d beat me in the election that the people came out. In fact, they were expecting to lose. And then they ended up winning by a lot because of the coattails. And they said, there’s no way that they’ve done many polls prior to the election. There was no way that they won. Ballots were dropped in massive numbers and we’re trying to get to those numbers. And we will have them. They’ll take a period of time, certified. But they’re massive numbers and far greater than the 11,779. The other thing, dead people. So dead people voted. And I think the number is close to 5,000 people. And they went to obituaries. They went to all sorts of methods to come up with an accurate number. And a minimum is close to about 5,000 voters. The bottom line is when you add it all up and then you start adding 300, 000 fake ballots.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","07:51"
"President Trump","Then the other thing they said is in Fulton County and other areas, and this may or may not, because this just came up this morning, that they are burning their ballots, that they are shredding ballots and removing equipment. They’re changing the equipment on the Dominion machines. And that’s not legal. And they supposedly shredded, I think they said 3000 pounds of ballots. And that just came to us as a report today. And it’s a very sad situation. But Brad, if you took the minimum numbers were many, many times above the 11,779, and many of those numbers are certified or they will be certified. But they are certified. Those are numbers that are there that exist. And that beat the margin, the margin of loss, they beat it, I mean, by a lot.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","09:04"
"President Trump","And people should be happy to have an accurate count, instead of an election where there’s turmoil. I mean there’s turmoil in Georgia and other places. You’re not the only one. I mean, we have other States that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly. But this is something that’s, as an example, I think in Detroit, and I think there’s a good section of your state actually, which we’re not sure, so we’re not going to report it yet. But in Detroit we had, I think it was 139% of the people voted. That’s not too good. And Pennsylvania, they had well over 200,000 more votes than they had people voting. And that doesn’t play too well. And the legislature there is, which is Republican, is extremely activist and angry. But I mean, there were other things also that were almost as bad as that. But they had, as an example of Michigan, a tremendous number of dead people that voted, I think Mark it was 18,000.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","10:11"
"President Trump","Some unbelievably high number, much higher than yours. You were in the 4 to 5,000 category. And that was checked out laboriously by going through the obituary columns in the newspapers. So I guess with all of it being said, Brad, the bottom line and provisional ballots, again, you’ll have to tell me about the provisional ballots. But we have a lot of people that were complaining that they weren’t able to vote because they were already voted for. These are great people. And they were shell shocked. I don’t know if you’d call that provisional ballots. In some States, we had a lot of provisional ballot situations where people were given a provisional ballot because when they walked into November 3rd, they were already voted for. So that’s it. I mean, we have many, many times the number of votes necessary to win this State and we won the State and we won it very substantially and easily and we’re getting… We have… Much of this is they’re certified, far more certified that we need. But we’re getting additional number certified too. And we’re getting pictures of drop boxes being delivered and delivered late and delivered three days later in some cases, plus we have many affidavits to that effect.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","11:22"
"Mark Meadows","So Mr. President, if I, I might be able to jump in and I’ll give Brad a chance, Mr. Secretary, obviously there are allegations where we believe that not every vote or fair vote and legal vote was counted. And that’s at odds with the representation from the secretary of state’s office. What I’m hopeful for is there some way that we can find some kind of an agreement to look at this a little bit more fully. The president mentioned Fulton County, but in some of these areas where there seems to be a difference of where the facts seem to lead. And so Mr. Secretary, I was hopeful that, in a spirit of cooperation and compromise is there’s something that we can at least have a discussion to look at some of these allegations to find a path forward, that’s less litigious?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","12:50"
"Brad Raffensperger","Well, I listened to what the president has just said, President Trump, we’ve had several lawsuits and we’ve had to respond in court to the lawsuits and the contentions. We don’t agree that you have one. I didn’t agree about the 200,000 number that you’d mentioned, and I’ll go through that point by point. What we had done is we gave our State Senate about one and a half hours of our time going through the election issue by issue. And then on the State House, the Government Affairs Committee, we gave them about two and a half hours of our time going back point by point on all the issues of contention. And then just a few days ago, we met with our US congressmen, Republican congressmen. And we gave them about two hours of our time talking about this past election. Going back, primarily what you’ve talked about, you focused in on primarily, I believe it’s the absentee ballot process. I don’t believe that you’re really questioning the Dominion machines because we did a hand re-tally, a 100% re-tally of all the ballots and compare that to what the machine said. And it came up with virtually the same result. Then we did the recount, and we got virtually the same result. So I guess we can probably take that off the table. I don’t think there’s an issue about that. I think what you [crosstalk 00:15:33].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","14:02"
"President Trump","Well, Brad. Not that there’s not an issue, because we have a big issue with Dominion in other states and perhaps in yours. But we haven’t felt we needed to go there. And just to maybe put a little different spin on what Mark is saying, Mark Meadows, yeah we’d like to go further, but we don’t really need to. We have all the votes we need. We won the state. If you took, these are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","15:33"
"President Trump","These are the most minimal numbers, the numbers that I gave you, those are numbers that are certified, your absentee ballots sent to vacant addresses, your out-of-state voters, 4,925. When you add them up, it’s many more times, it’s many times the 11,779 number. So we could go through … we have not gone through your Dominion, so we can’t give them blessing. I mean, in other states, we think we found tremendous corruption with Dominion machines, but we’ll have to see. But we only lost the state by that number, 11,000 votes, and 779. So with that being said, with just what we have we’re giving you minimal numbers. We’re doing the most conservative numbers possible. We’re many times, many, many times above the margin. Mark, I don’t think we have to go through each-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","16:03"

"President Trump","Because what’s the difference between winning the election by two votes and winning it by half a million votes. I think I probably did win it by half a million. One of the things that happened, Brad, is we have other people coming in now from Alabama and from South Carolina, and from other states, and they’re saying it’s impossible for you to have lost Georgia. We won … in Alabama we set a record, got the highest vote ever. In Georgia, we set a record with a massive amount of votes. And they say it’s not possible to have lost Georgia. And I can tell you by our rallies, I can tell you by the rally I’m having on Monday night, the place they already have lines of people standing out front waiting. It’s just not possible to have lost Georgia, it’s not possible.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","17:06"
"President Trump","When I heard it was close, I said, “There’s no way.” But they dropped a lot of votes in there late at night, you know that, Brad. And that’s what we are working on very, very stringently. But regardless of those votes, with all of it being said, we lost by essentially 11,000 votes, and we have many more votes already calculated and certified too. So I just don’t know, Mark, I don’t know what’s the purpose. I won’t give Dominion a pass because we found too many bad things. But we don’t need Dominion or anything else. We have won this election in Georgia based on all of this. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that, Brad. I mean, having the correct … the people of Georgia are angry. And these numbers are going to be repeated on Monday night, along with others that we’re going to have by that time, which are much more substantial even.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","17:54"
"President Trump","And the people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there’s nothing wrong with saying that you’ve recalculated. Because the 2,236 in absentee ballots, I mean, they’re all exact numbers that were done by accounting firms, law firms, et cetera. And even if you cut them in half, cut them in half, and cut them in half again, it’s more votes than we need.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","18:53"
"Brad Raffensperger","Well, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is the data you have is wrong. We talked to the congressmen and they were surprised. I guess there was a person named Mr. Braynard who came to these meetings and presented data, and he said that there was dead people, I believe it was upward of 5,000. The actual number were two, two. Two people that were dead that voted and so that’s wrong. That was two.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","19:23"

"Cleta Mitchell","Well, I would say, Mr. Secretary, one of the things that we have requested and what we said was, and if you read our petition, it said that we took the names and birth years, and we had certain information available to us. We have asked from your office for records that only you have, and so we said there is a universe of people who have the same name and same birth year and died. But we don’t have the records that you have. And one of the things that we have been suggesting formally and informally for weeks now is for you to make available to us the records that would be necessary to confirm-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","19:54"
"President Trump","[crosstalk 00:20:48] But Cleta, even before you do that and not even including that, that’s why I hardly even included that number, although in one state, we have a tremendous amount of dead people so I don’t know. I’m sure we do in Georgia, too. I’m sure we do in Georgia, too. But is that we’re so far ahead of these numbers, even the phony ballots of Ruby Freeman, known scammer. You know the internet, you know what was trending on the internet? “Where’s Ruby?” Because they thought she’d be in jail. “Where’s Ruby?” It’s crazy, it’s crazy. The minimum number is 18,000 for Ruby, but they think it’s probably about 56,000. But the minimum number is 18,000 on the Ruby Freeman night where she ran back in there when everybody was gone and she stuffed the ballot boxes. Let’s face it, Brad, I mean, they did it in slow motion replay magnified, right? She stuffed the ballot boxes. They were stuffed like nobody has ever seen them stuffed before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","20:48"
"President Trump","So there’s a term for it when it’s a machine instead of a ballot box, but she stuffed the machine. She stuffed the ballot. Each ballot went three times, they were showing, here’s ballot number, here it is a second time, third time, next ballot. I mean, look, Brad, we have a new tape that we’re going to release, it’s devastating. And by the way, that one event is much more than the 11,000 votes that we’re talking about. That one event was a disaster. But it was something that … it can’t be disputed. And again, we have a version that you haven’t seen, but it’s magnified. It’s magnified and you can see everything. For some reason, they put it in three times, each ballot and I don’t know why three times. Why not five times, right? Yeah, go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","21:55"

It was late in the evening, late in the early … in the morning. And there was nobody else in the room. Where were the poll watches? And why did they say a water main broke, which they did, and which is reported in the newspapers. They said they left. They ran out because of a water main break. And there was no water main, there was nothing. There was no break. There was no water main break. But if you take out everything, where were the Republican poll watchers, even where was the Democrat poll watchers? Because there were none. And then you say, “Well, they left their station.” If you look at the tape and this was reviewed by professional police and detectives, and other people. When they left in a rush, everybody left in a rush because of the water main, but everybody left in a rush. These people left their station.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","23:24"
"President Trump","When they came back, they didn’t go to their station. They went to the apron wrapped around the table, under which were thousands and thousands of ballots in a box that was not an official or a sealed box. And then they took those and they went back to a different station. So if they would have come back, they would have walked to their station, and they would have continued to work. But they couldn’t do even that because that’s illegal, because they had no Republican poll watchers. And remember, her reputation is … she’s known all over the internet, Brad. She’s known all over. I’m telling you, “Where’s Ruby?” was one of the hot items on the … Ruby, they knew her. “Where’s Ruby?” So Brad, there can be no justification for that. And I give everybody the benefit of the doubt.

We can go through signature verification and we’ll find hundreds of thousands of signatures, if you let us do it. And the only way you can do it, as you know, is to go to the past, but you didn’t do that in Cobb County. You just looked at one page compared to another. The only way you can do a signature verification is go from the one that signed it on November whatever recently, and compare it to two years ago, four years ago, six years ago or even one, and you’ll find that you have many different signatures. But in Fulton, where they dumped ballots, you will find that you have many that aren’t even signed, and you have many that are forgeries, okay? You know that. You know that.

That’s a big risk to you and to Ryan, your lawyer. That’s a big risk. But they are shredding ballots, in my opinion, based on what I’ve heard, and they are removing machinery, and they’re moving it as fast as they can, both of which are criminal finds, and you can’t let it happen and you are letting it happen.

I don’t know. A lot of people think it wasn’t a mistake. It was much more criminal than that, but it’s a big problem in Georgia and it’s not a problem that’s going away.

"Mark Meadows","Yeah. So let me recommend, Ryan, if you and Kurt will get together when we get off of this phone call. If you could get together and work out a plan to address some of what we’ve got with your attorneys where we can actually look at the data. For example, Mr. Secretary, you said there was only two dead people that would vote. I can promise you there are more than that. That may be what your investigation shows, but I can promise you there were more than that. But at the same time, I think it’s important that we go ahead and move expeditiously to try to do this and resolve it as quickly as we possibly can. And if that’s the good next step, hopefully we can finish this phone call and go ahead and agree that the two of you will get together immediately.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","58:48"
"President Trump","Well, why don’t my lawyers show you where you got the information? It’ll show the Secretary of State. And you don’t even have to look at any names. We don’t want names. We don’t care. But we got that information from you. And Stacey Abrams is laughing about… She’s going around saying these guys are dumber than a rock. What she’s done to this party is unbelievable. I tell you. And I only ran against her once, and that was with a guy named Brian Kemp. And I beat her. If I didn’t run, Brian wouldn’t have had even a shot either in the general or the primary. He was dead. Dead as a doornail. He never thought he had a shot at either one of them. What a schmuck I was, but that’s the way it is. That’s the way it is.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","59:43"
"President Trump","I would like you to… For the attorneys [inaudible 00:12:31], I’d like you to perhaps meet with Ryan ideally tomorrow, because I think we should come to a resolution of this before the election. Otherwise you’re going to have people just not voting. They don’t want to vote. They hate the state. They hate the governor, and they hate the Secretary of State. I will tell you that right now. The only people that like you are people that will never vote for you. You know that, Brad, right? They like you. They like you. They can’t believe what they found. They want more people like you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-georgia-phone-call-transcript-brad-raffensperger-recording","Donald Trump Georgia Phone Call Transcript with Sec. of State Brad Raffensperger: Says He Wants to ‘Find’ Votes","01:00:29"
"President Trump","Look, can you get together tomorrow? Brad, we just want the truth. It’s simple. And everyone’s going to look very good if the truth comes out. It’s okay. It takes a little while, but let the truth come out. The real truth is I won by 400,000 votes at least. That’s the real truth, but we don’t need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes.
