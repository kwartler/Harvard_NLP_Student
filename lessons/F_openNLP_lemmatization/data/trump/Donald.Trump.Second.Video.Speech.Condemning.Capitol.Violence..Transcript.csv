"Donald Trump","My fellow Americans, I want to speak to you tonight about the troubling events of the past week. As I have said, the incursion of the US Capitol struck at the very heart of our Republic. It angered and appalled millions of Americans across the political spectrum. I want to be very clear, I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week. Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-second-video-speech-condemning-capitol-violence-transcript","Donald Trump Second Video Speech Condemning Capitol Violence: Transcript","00:00"
"Donald Trump","Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law, supporting the men and women of law enforcement and upholding our nation’s most sacred traditions and values. Mob violence goes against everything I believe in and everything our movement stands for. No true supporter of mine could ever endorse political violence. No true supporter of mine could ever disrespect law enforcement or our great American flag. No true supporter of mine could ever threaten or harass their fellow Americans. If you do any of these things, you are not supporting our movement, you are attacking it and you are attacking our country. We can not tolerate it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-second-video-speech-condemning-capitol-violence-transcript","Donald Trump Second Video Speech Condemning Capitol Violence: Transcript","00:35"
"Donald Trump","Tragically, over the course of the past year made so difficult because of COVID-19, we have seen political violence spiral out of control. We have seen too many riots, too many mobs, too many acts of intimidation and destruction. It must stop. Whether you are on the right or on the left, a Democrat or a Republican, there is never a justification for violence, no excuses, no exceptions. America is a nation of laws. Those who engaged in the attacks last week will be brought to justice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-second-video-speech-condemning-capitol-violence-transcript","Donald Trump Second Video Speech Condemning Capitol Violence: Transcript","01:26"
"Donald Trump","Now I am asking everyone who has ever believed in our agenda to be thinking of ways to ease tensions, calm tempers, and help to promote peace in our country. There has been reporting that additional demonstrations are being planned in the coming days, both here in Washington and across the country. I have been briefed by the US Secret Service on the potential threats. Every American deserves to have their voice heard in a respectful and peaceful way. That is your First Amendment Right. But I cannot emphasize that there must be no violence, no law breaking and no vandalism of any kind.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-second-video-speech-condemning-capitol-violence-transcript","Donald Trump Second Video Speech Condemning Capitol Violence: Transcript","02:12"
"Donald Trump","Everyone must follow our laws and obey the instructions of law enforcement. I have directed federal agencies to use all necessary resources to maintain order. In Washington, D.C., We are bringing in thousands of National Guard members to secure the city and ensure that a transition can occur safely and without incident. Like all of you, I was shocked and deeply saddened by the calamity at the Capitol last week. I want to thank the hundreds of millions of incredible American citizens who have responded to this moment with calm, moderation and grace. We will get through this challenge just like we always do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-second-video-speech-condemning-capitol-violence-transcript","Donald Trump Second Video Speech Condemning Capitol Violence: Transcript","03:02"
"Donald Trump","I also want to say a few words about the unprecedented assault on free speech we have seen in recent days. These are tense and difficult times. The efforts to censor, cancel and blacklist our fellow citizens are wrong and they are dangerous. What is needed now is for us to listen to one another, not to silence one another. All of us can choose by our actions to rise above the ranker and find common ground and shared purpose. We must focus on advancing the interests of the whole nation, delivering the miracle vaccines, defeating the pandemic, rebuilding the economy, protecting our national security and upholding the rule of law.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-second-video-speech-condemning-capitol-violence-transcript","Donald Trump Second Video Speech Condemning Capitol Violence: Transcript","03:51"
"Donald Trump","Today, I am calling on all Americans to overcome the passions of the moment and join together as one American people. Let us choose to move forward united for the good of our families, our communities, and our country. Thank you. God bless you and God bless America.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-second-video-speech-condemning-capitol-violence-transcript","Donald Trump Second Video Speech Condemning Capitol Violence: Transcript","04:49"
