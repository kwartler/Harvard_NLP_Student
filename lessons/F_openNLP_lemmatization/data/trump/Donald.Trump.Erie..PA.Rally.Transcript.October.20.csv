"Donald Trump","Thank you very much. Hello, Erie. Remember that great victory we had? What a victory. 14 days from now, we’re going to win the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and we are going to win four more years in the White House .with your vote, we will continue to cut your taxes, cut regulations, support our great police, protect our second amendment, defend our borders, keep jobs and wealth in America where it belongs.

"Donald Trump","We will deliver record prosperity, epic growth and you know that? have you seen what’s been going on? How well we’re doing? Did you see the recent poll just came out? 56% of the people want to be here, not four years ago. They want to be with us in what we’re calling… we’re rounding the turn of the pandemic. 56%, and it’s a record. Epic job growth, safe vaccines that quickly end the pandemic. It’s ending. Normal life, that’s all we want. You know what we want? Normal life. Normal life will finally resume and next year will be the greatest economic year in the history of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","07:48"
"Donald Trump","This is an election between the Trump super recovery, which is happening right now and a Biden depression. If he gets elected, you will have a depression the likes of which you’ve never seen. You know he’s going to double, triple and now quadruple your taxes. I don’t think so. I think I know the people of Erie pretty well. They don’t like that. It’s a choice between our plan to kill the virus or Biden’s plan to kill the American dream. That’s what he’d be doing. Biden will delay therapies, postpone the vaccine, prolong the pandemic, close your schools, shut down our country. By the way, Pennsylvania’s been shut down long enough. Get your governor to open up Pennsylvania.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","08:43"
"Donald Trump","Get your governor to open it up. He will massively raise your taxes, bury you in regulations, dismantle your police departments, dissolve our borders, confiscate your guns, second amendment. Oh, you’re so lucky I’m president. You wouldn’t have a second amendment. Eliminate private healthcare, terminate religious liberty, destroy the suburbs. I’m saving the suburbs. Knocked out the regulation. No, you don’t like projects being next to you beautiful house, your American dream.

"Donald Trump","Joe Biden will ban fracking and abolish Pennsylvania Energy. How many times did he say, “You’re fracking.” Mining industries will be outlawed, exiled, eradicated, and totally extinguished. And you know it because it’s not up to Sleepy Joe. He’s Gonzo. It’s up to the others of the party. Joe Biden has repeatedly pledged to ban fracking, right? You’ve all heard it. Have you heard it? Till he got the nomination then he came to Pennsylvania. He said, “Oh, well, I guess it’s okay.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","10:19"

If we had a great year for a hundred years, we couldn’t make a $100 trillion. The $100 trillion socialist green new deal, which would eliminate fossil fuels. At this very moment, Biden’s website includes a pledge to mandate net zero carbon emissions, which means he would end all fracking. It’s what he said. He said it for a year and a half, he said it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","10:55"

I mean, did you see what they did to West Virginia and other places, including Pennsylvania when they were here? Don’t forget. They’d been here for eight years before me. If they did a good job, I would have never run. I didn’t need this. I didn’t need this.

He’s going to. Tonight. I want to do something. I want to give you. This is an original Donald Trump Broadway play. I had it done specifically… First time I’ve ever pulled it out. I had it done specifically for the people of Erie because you guys like energy. You like being energy independent. Do you like that? Energy… doesn’t that sound… We don’t need all these far away lands and everything else. We are now energy independent, and we’re going to keep it that way. Take a look at this clip. We had it made up, and I think you’ll like. First time I’ve ever done this, right? First time. Go ahead.

"Donald Trump","What we don’t show is his more current version. “Oh, yes, we’ll have fracking.” The fake news, they don’t do anything about it. They don’t even talk to him about it.

Just like he wiped out your steel industry and I brought it back. I brought it back. Only by voting for me, can you save your fracking in Pennsylvania.

We’re all in this together. We’re all in it. As long as I’m president, we will remain the number one producer of energy anywhere in the world. You know we’re now number one in the world with Pennsylvania. You, Texas, we have some great… How about North Dakota does a great job? North Dakota, Oklahoma, so many different… Ohio does a phenomenal job. Phenomenal. A couple of Ohioans and they have to have the fracking and they have to have the energy and we need the energy. You looked at your car. When did you think you were going to see $2 a gallon and less. You didn’t think you were going to see that. That’s like a tax cut.

"Donald Trump","G is vibrant. Last year, I visited the Shell petrochemical plant in Beaver County, the largest investment in your state’s history. Our opponents will put it out of business. They want to put it out of business. I don’t think that’s a great idea. Joe Biden has made a corrupt bargain exchange for his party’s nomination. He’s handed control of his party over to socialists, I added another word, communists, Marxists, left-wing extremists, and they’re full of hate and rage and scorn for the middle-class, and for everybody, frankly, for the middle-class and for everybody. The Biden Harris, Kamala, you like Kamala? Kamala. I’ll tell you. Did our Vice President do a great job? He did. Did a great job. I said, “Mike, was too easy.” But the Biden Harris agenda is projected to slash the typical American’s income by $6,500. This is in the Wall Street Journal today. A Nightmare for Pennsylvania family, $6,500. And that’s just, cut it down, what you could be making if you do this and what we’re doing, because for the last 47 years, Joe Biden has been outsourcing your jobs, offshoring your factories and selling out the American worker. And who knows it better than Pennsylvania? Look at all the empty halts that you still have despite all the jobs we’ve brought back. America lost 10,000 factories while he was Vice President. He has no clue, by the way. Just so you understand, he has no clue. How many? Oh, that’s okay.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","17:03"
"Donald Trump","He’s a servant of the globalists, lobbyists, wealthy donors and Washington vultures who got rich bleeding America dry. You know, I said the other day, I never thought of it because they’re raising a lot of money, $300 million. I could be the king of all fundraisers. I would be the greatest that ever lived, the President of the United States. All they have to do is give me a list of the top hundred companies. I’ll call the President of everyone. They will pay me whatever I want. I would set every record. The problem is I’d owe them. Because when they call and they have a problem for a lot more money than we’re talking about, it’s hard to say, “Hey, they were nice. They treated you good.” I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do that. We don’t need the money. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to do that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","18:51"

"Donald Trump","In 2016, Pennsylvania voted to fire this depraved political establishment and you elected an outsider as President who is finally putting America first. America first. The fact is whether you like it or not, whether you want to hear it or not. Joe Biden is a corrupt politician. He’s a corrupt politician. And smoking gun emails show that the Biden family sold the Vice Presidency for a very, very substantial amount of money, more money than anybody would believe. He let China plunder your jobs while his family raked in millions of dollars from China and foreign nations.

They try to take away your guns, second amendment, they want to take it away, while they enjoy private security that’s fully armed. They support crippling lockdowns like your Governor is doing, while their jobs and their industries remain totally exempt.

I actually went to college in Pennsylvania, okay, so I think I have more in common. But it’s not his home state. He comes from a place called Delaware and he never leaves Delaware. [inaudible 00:22:43] Delaware, too. But he never leaves. Here, he’s making another speech, well he doesn’t make many speeches, either. He took a five day lid. You know what a lid is?

Don’t touch. Don’t touch me, Mike, we’ll get in trouble with the media. They’ll say, “They touched each other.” Do you ever see this? If he would have done that … I saved you, Mike.

We’re going to make America great again again because of Donald J. Trump. There’s no flu that’s going to keep this man down. He makes the Energizer Bunny look like a dead head. This guy never stops. He never sleeps. He is totally dedicated to each one of you and we should be totally dedicated to him.

"Donald Trump","Under my administration, we built the greatest economy in the history of the world, and now we’re doing it again. In my first three years, we increased family income over $6,000. Listen to this, more than five times, the gains in all eight years under the previous administration. Think of that. In just a short period of time. African-American unemployment, Hispanic-American, unemployment, and Asian-American unemployment all reached their lowest levels in the history of our country. Think of that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","37:02"
"Donald Trump","We lifted nearly 7 million Americans out of poverty, a record.

That’s never happened before.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","37:41"

Hey, thank goodness. But you know what? It was two weeks ago, 7.8%. Now 7.8, well, we’re at 3.4 and 3.5, I don’t like to say 7.8, but when you think about it, they were saying, “We’re going to 42%.” You know, not our fault. We had this plague come in from China. We’re going to 42%, 38%. 7.8% and heading down rapidly.

"Donald Trump","Under Biden, it took 30 months to recover more than half of the jobs lost in a crisis. We did it in less than five months. We’ve spent the last four years reversing the damage Joe Biden inflicted over the last 47 years. You saw what he’s done. You know, it’s amazing. He’s always like, it’s not him, he’s not being critical, but he has writers. They say, “Let’s do this, that.” You know, have all this up. Vice-President Biden said, he has no idea what he said, but you know what I get … he didn’t leave long ago. He was here for eight years as vice-president and 47 years plus as a politician in Washington. Think of it. And he’s always like, “Why didn’t you do this?” Why the hell didn’t he do it? Why didn’t he do it? 47 years, Joe, why didn’t you do it? He supported NAFTA, TPP, which would have destroyed your industry. And China’s entry into the World Trade Organization.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","38:52"
"Donald Trump","One cruel betrayal after another. It’s true. I mean, what he’s done. For decades or politicians spent trillions of dollars rebuilding foreign nations, fighting foreign wars, and defending foreign borders. Now we’re doing our borders. Do you like that better? But now we’re finally protecting our nation, rebuilding our cities, and we are bringing our jobs, our factories, and our troops, our beautiful, beloved trope, we’re bringing them all back home. It’s time. 19 years to save our auto industry. I withdrew from the last administration’s Transpacific Partnership. Pennsylvania gained, Michigan, auto factories, auto plants being built all over Michigan. Ohio. There wasn’t a plan built in 42 years. Now they’re being built all over the place. In Japan, I told the prime minister, you have to give us plants. You can’t just keep sending us cars. You got to make them over here. And they started and you’re a big beneficiary of it. To defend our steel, that aluminum workers, I imposed very historic tariffs on dumped steel, right? And US steel, all of your places started doing great.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","39:54"
"Donald Trump","I ended the NAFTA nightmare and signed the brand new USMCA, just kicked in. You know how I know it’s good? Because the other two countries aren’t so happy. It’s good. They took advantage of us for a long time. I took the toughest ever action to confront China’s rampant theft of American jobs. Nobody has ever done. And you know what? Nobody’s ever done anything like this to China. We’re taking in billions. Right now we’re taking in billions, billions and billions of dollars. It affects you a little bit. We gave $28 billion to our farmers because they were targeted by China. And that was just a small fraction of what I took in. Under my leadership we achieved the most secure border, Southern border in US history. So we’re building 10 miles. You know, the wall is going to be completed very soon. And we had radical opposition to the wall, radical opposition. We’ll be at 500 miles very soon and will be completed with the wall.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","41:14"
"Donald Trump","And by the way, Mexico, you know, they keep saying, Mexico is paying for the wall. They understand, that they’re paying for the wall. Mexico is paying for it and it’s very high just like I said it would be. And it actually goes down very deep. You know why? Two reasons actually, number one, to hold it up. Number two, to stop the tunnels. My opponent’s immigration plan is the most extreme proposal ever put forward by a presidential candidate. Biden would eliminate US borders. How about that? Do you like that idea?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","42:19"

Crazy Bernie. Bernie, I’ll tell you what, he’s one of the greatest losers. And I mean that in a very nice way. Twice they took it away from him, right? Hillary took it away. And then Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren took it away. Because she stayed in on Super Tuesday.

I never happened to receive that. I got other awards. I never got the best sportsmanship award. But Bernie Sanders should be given sportsman of the year. Sportsmanship, I guess, right? No, no. It’s amazing. This happened to him twice. Is Bernie running again in four more years? Bernie, are you running again? Crazy Bernie. But no, but they signed, they didn’t sign. I guess they have this deal, the manifesto, they agreed. Biden would eliminate and she’s more liberal than him.

"Donald Trump","And there’s nobody that treated Biden worse than Kamala. That’s why I said, “Why would he ever pick her?” There’s nobody that treated him worse. Biden would eliminate US borders by implementing nationwide catch and release, which I ended. If it’s okay with you, you know what I did? You catch them, what do you do? They’re murderers, they’re rapists. You catch them and then you have to release them. This is called catch … this is a serious … this was a Democrat program headed up by crying Chuck Schumer.

And you say in four and a half years, please come back for a trial. Nobody comes back. A couple of really stupid ones come back. Other than making every community into a sanctuary city and suspending all removals of illegal aliens. They want to suspend, in this manifesto, no more moving out illegal aliens, even if they’re really bad, including no violent criminals. You catch MS-13, can’t move them out. Thank you very much.

You can’t see it. Other than that, it’s not so great. You can’t see it.

So, we’ve made it powerful again. We’ve made America wealthy again. Stock market, new records, your 401ks, everybody happy with their 401k?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","01:00:27"
"Donald Trump","You want to see your 401ks crash? It was on today. Varney, Varney, you know Stuart. He had a gentlemen on, he said, “You know, if Trump gets in, the market’s going to go through the roof. If Trump loses and this other guy gets in, you’re going to have a problem like you’ve never seen before.” And I agree. Your 401ks, your stocks, you want to see them drop like a rock? If you want to have some fun with your family, explaining, “Why is it down 80% dad? We don’t love you anymore, dad.” Now, your 401ks are doing great. Everything’s doing great. We’re going to be in a position very soon, like we’ve never been in, even better than we were a year ago. We’ve made America strong again. We have made America proud again. We have made America safe again and we will make America great again. Thank you very much, Pennsylvania. Go out and vote. Go out and vote. Thank you, Pennsylvania. Thank you, thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-erie-pa-rally-transcript-october-20","Donald Trump Erie, PA Rally Transcript October 20","01:02:34"
