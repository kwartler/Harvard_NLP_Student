"Donald Trump","Thank you very much, please. So we had a couple of really great days in India. Prime Minister Modi is a terrific man. He’s a terrific leader. And we have a lot of things going in terms of product being purchased by India. We just had a meeting. A lot of the press was there. I thought it was a great meeting with some of the biggest businessmen in the world. They come from India, they’re agreeing to invest billions and billions of dollars. You heard it for yourself. They’re going to be investing billions of dollars in our country. That was the purpose of the trip. Also, we’re all set for $3 billion worth of helicopters, the Apaches and various other types in addition to other equipment. They’re buying that, and they’re buying a lot. They’re going to be buying a lot, and they’re also going to be buying a lot of our energy, all forms of our energy, because they need energy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","00:00"
"Donald Trump","And we have more than anybody. We’re number one in the world now in energy. So that’s going to be very exciting. But I thought it was a great two days, was a fantastic two days. I’m going to be not at all controversial, because I don’t want to blow the two days plus two days of travel on one answer, one little answer, little answer. Like John will ask me one little simple question, and you’ll blow it out. And that will be the end of the trip. They won’t even talk about the trip. I’ll be very, very conservative in my answers if you don’t mind. But we did. We had a great time. We had great meetings and we’re going for a state dinner. And then after that we get back onto the plane and we go back home. It’s going to be about 19 hours, but we look forward to it, get in tomorrow.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","00:56"
"Donald Trump","But this is a tremendous country. It’s 1.4 billion, probably at least the most people. And it’s a tremendous market and they really like us. And I think they like us more now than they’ve ever liked us, frankly. We have a terrific, a really great relationship between the prime minister and myself. So we’re going to be doing a lot of things. I think it was really, really worth it. You may ask about the coronavirus, which is very well under control in our country. We have very few people with it. And the people that have it are in all cases, I have not heard anything other, maybe there’s something new because for two days I haven’t been seeing too much of that news, very much news because it’s been very all encompassing. We’ve accomplished a lot. We had a lot of meetings as you know. But the people are getting better, they’re all getting better.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","01:42"
"Donald Trump","We brought in some Americans from a ship, because it was really the right thing to do. And they’re in quarantine. And we think they’ll be in very good shape very, very soon. We discussed a lot of different elements. We actually discussed the coronavirus, and at this moment India doesn’t have much of a problem, they feel. It wasn’t expressed that they did, which is great. And I think that whole situation will start working out. A lot of talent, a lot of brain power is being put behind it. Two and a half billion dollars we’re putting in. I see that Chuck Schumer criticized that. He thought it should be more. And if I gave more, he’d say it should be less, automatic with these characters. They’re just not good for our country. If I gave more, he’d say it should be less.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","02:39"
"Donald Trump","But that’s what they do in the meantime. That’s all they can do. They’re not getting anything done. We have so many things we could get done. We could so easily do prescription drug. Last year was the first year in 51 years where prescription drug prices went down. But we could drive them down really well if we had the Democrat votes. We need some additional votes. We would really drive them down, as you know. So with that, I think what we’ll do is take some questions and we’ll go to a nice state dinner and then we go home. Yeah. John, go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","03:35"
"John","Mr. President, you just addressed coronavirus, so I will put that aside for the moment. You tweeted about Justice Sotomayor yesterday, saying that she and Justice Ginsburg should recuse themselves from future cases dealing with the administration. What is the basis for your opinion on that?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","04:08"
"Donald Trump","It’s very obvious. I always thought frankly that Justice Ginsburg should do it because she went, while during the campaign when I was running, I don’t know who she was for. Perhaps she was for Hillary Clinton, if you can believe it. But she said some things that were obviously very inappropriate. She later sort of apologized. I wouldn’t say it was an apology, but she sort of apologized. And then Justice Sotomayor said what she said yesterday, you know very well what she said yesterday. It was a big story. And I just don’t know how they can not recuse themselves for anything having to do with Trump or Trump related.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","04:27"
"Donald Trump","The right thing to do is that now as a Supreme Court Justice there’s a different standard. But at the same time I think it’s a higher standard in a certain sense. So they’ll have to decide what to do. But her statement was so inappropriate when you’re a justice of the Supreme Court and it’s almost what she’s trying to do is take the people that do feel a different way, and get them to vote the way that she would like them to vote. I just thought it was so inappropriate. Such a terrible statement for a Supreme Court justice.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","05:06"
"John","What was inappropriate about the statement? I’m not an attorney so I can’t really look into it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","05:34"
"Donald Trump","You know what the statement was, John.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","05:39"
"John","She seemed to criticize the White House for running to the Supreme Court at the drop of a hat to seek [crosstalk 00:00:05:46].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","05:40"
"Donald Trump","No, I don’t think that was it. But I think what she did say is she’s trying to shame the way I look at it. She’s trying to shame people with perhaps a different view into voting her way. And that’s so inappropriate. So let’s see what happens. We have things, whether or not they recuse themselves both. Look, Justice Ginsburg during my campaign, I protested at the time, she apologized in a very minor form. And what Justice Sotomayor said yesterday was really highly inappropriate. And everybody agrees to that, virtually everybody I’ve seen. I’ve seen papers on it. People cannot believe that she said it. Yeah, please. Go ahead.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","05:45"
"Speaker 1","Thank you, Mr. President. The intelligence community believes that Russia is trying to meddle in the 2020 election. Do you agree with their assessment, and what is your message to Vladimir Putin about potentially interfering, regardless of the candidate they support?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","06:28"
"Donald Trump","You know what, I’m reading, and again, I’m over here for the last number of days. But they went to see Bernie and they told Bernie about something having to do with, they want Bernie to win. They did not tell me. Intelligence never told me. And we have a couple of people here that would know very well. They never told me anything about that. And it was a strange thing that they went to Bernie. And now I find out, if I believe what I read in some of your documents, in some of your papers that it was highly exaggerated. And frankly I think it’s disgraceful. And I think it was leaks from the intelligence committee, House version. And I think that they leaked it. I think probably Schiff leaked it, but some people within that… Schiff leaked it, in my opinion.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","06:44"
"Donald Trump","And he shouldn’t be leaking things like that. That’s a terrible thing to do. But basically they would like to see Bernie as probably winning. And looks like he’s winning and he’s got a head of steam. And they maybe don’t want him for obvious reasons, so they don’t want him. So they put out a thing that rushes back in him. This is what they do. I’ve gone through it for a long time, I get it. I get the game better than anybody. And that’s the way it is. Terrible thing to say. And they didn’t say it about me. I will say this, somebody leaked it in intelligence, but nobody ever told me that. We have Ambassador O’Brien in the audience someplace. And he can tell you that this was never discussed with us, so I think it’s terrible. They ought to stop the leaking from intelligence committee. And if they don’t stop it, I can’t imagine that people are not going to go after them and find out what’s happening.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","07:32"

"Donald Trump","I think India would like to see it happen. I spoke with Prime Minister Modi today and I think they would very much like to see it happen. And we’re pretty close, we’ll see what’s going on. We’ve got two days now under our belt without violence or I guess a minimum of violence. And we’ll see what happens, but people want to see it. It’s very interesting that one, is everybody’s happy about it. Even people that are normally against me 99.9% of the time, because we’ve been there for 19 years and everybody would like to see it happen. I was actually surprised. I thought the Schumers of the world would say whatever the opposite is. Because that’s all they can do, crying Chuck. But people are really happy to see that we’re trying very hard. It would bring it down to 8,600. And from there we’ll make a decision as to what the final outcome would be.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","08:44"
"Donald Trump","But there’s been tremendous praise for the fact that we’re doing something. Other administrations have tried to do something, in particular, the previous administration for a long time. They were never able to get anything done. And we’re really serving not as a military force as we are a police force. And we’re not a police force. They have to police their own country. We’re not a police force. It’s like law enforcement and that’s the way it is. So we’d like to, I can tell you after 19 years, we’d like to bring our young people back home. That’s where they want to be, and we’ll always have intelligence there. We’ll have other things there, but for the most part, we would like to bring them back home.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","09:39"
"Donald Trump","We want to watch the area. The area is a hotbed of problems. And when we bring them home, we’ll let them know that if something happens, we will hit them so hard. And we could win that easily if I wanted to kill millions of people. I don’t want to kill millions of people, innocent people. We could win that very easily. We don’t have to act as a police force. We could act as a military force to win, not a military force to just take care of things in that very, very difficult part of the world. It’s a very difficult part, very dangerous part of the world. So let’s see what happens. So far, so good. So far, but I’m very impressed with the kind of kudos we’re getting. Yes, please.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","10:22"
"Speaker 4","Mr. President, namaste. I’m Saurabh Shukla, editor in chief of News Mobile. If you remember, I interviewed you during your last campaign in New Jersey. And I asked you this question earlier at that time about a Trump doctrine on fighting out Islamic fundamentalism, which you spoke about and you discussed with Prime Minister Modi. And you spoke about a Modi Trump doctrine. So what is your roadmap to fight out Islamic radical terrorism?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","11:03"
"Donald Trump","I don’t think anybody’s done more than I have. If you look, because I came in and if you check your maps and look at Iraq and Syria, it was all over. In fact, they had it painted a certain color. I won’t tell you what color, because it doesn’t matter. Somebody will say it was a Republican color, so I don’t want to get people confused. But it happened to be red. And it was basically trying to show where ISIS was in those areas, and it was out of control. And I gave the orders, and we have 100% of the caliphate. We have tens of thousands of people in prisons now. They’re being guarded by the Kurds and others. Europe should take a lot of them back. So far they haven’t agreed to do that. They should do that because we did them a big favor.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","11:34"
"Donald Trump","We captured them, but I did that. We killed al-Baghdadi a few months ago and Soleimani is gone. He’s no longer putting roadside bombs all over the place. Somebody else may be, but he was the father, the king of the roadside bomb. All of those young people that you see with missing legs and missing legs and arms. I’ve seen every combination. The legs are gone. You go over to Walter Reed, I have to say the doctors at Walter Reed are incredible. What they’re able to do, incredible. But that’s what his thing was. He thought that was a beautiful weapon. Roadside bombs. It’s a coward’s bomb, and all of these young people that have been so badly hurt. And we did a big favor. In addition to that, as you know, Hamza bin Laden is now gone. He was looking to do damage and he’s gone. And al-Qaeda last week, you saw what happened there.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","12:22"
"Donald Trump","So nobody has done more than what I’ve done. but at the same time, Russia should do it, Iran should do it, Iraq should do it. Syria should do it. We’re in a different part of the world. We’re doing it. Everybody says you’re the only ones that can do it. At some point these other countries, Iran should do it. Iran hates ISIS and they should do it. And we’ve done a great job. We’ve taken our soldiers essentially out of Syria except for little hotspots that we’ll do that develop. But we’ve taken the oil and the soldiers we have, they’re the ones guarding the oil. We have the oil. So that’s all we have there. If you look, we are down to a small force in Iraq. And we’re down to a small force very shortly. But right now even we have a small force in Afghanistan, and so we’re moving out and moving around. But the only soldiers we have in terms of Syria, the predominant number of soldiers are the ones guarding the oil.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","13:24"
"Speaker 4","What about terror groups in Pakistan? That’s a big concern in this region. There are lot of terror groups who pose dangers to the United States and democracies like India as well.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","14:28"
"Donald Trump","I agree. But you also have other countries that can do this. The United States is 8,000 miles away. And they’re all saying, could you do it? Yeah, we could do it. We’ve been doing it for a long time, but I’ve been doing it much better than anyone else has done it. What we’ve done in the last couple of years has been incredible. We have 100% of the caliphate. Remember we had 99% I’d say, good, we’re leaving. And I was hit with, people couldn’t believe it. They said do 100, so we did 100. I did 100 with some great generals that knew exactly what they were doing. They were unbelievable. We took 100% of the caliphate. And we have thousands of prisoners right now locked up. And these are ISIS fighters and killed thousands. Not that I want to do that, I don’t want to do that. But that’s what we had to do. And when I came in, ISIS was all over the place. It was totally out of control. Please, thank you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","14:38"

"Donald Trump","We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me. He wants people to have religious freedom and very strongly, and he said that in India, they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom. And if you look back and look at what’s going on relative to other places especially, but they have really worked hard on religious freedom. I asked that question in front of a very large group of people today, and he talked about it. We talked about it for a long time, and I really believe that’s what he wants. As far as the individual attack, I heard about it, but I didn’t discuss that with him. That’s up to India. Yeah.

"Donald Trump","I was never a fan of Harvey Weinstein, as you know. In fact, he said he was going to work hard to defeat me in the election. How did that work out, by the way? I’m trying to figure that out. He was a person I didn’t like, never liked. I don’t know too much about the case, because as you know, I’ve been over here. Between traveling and being at meetings almost every hour of the day, every minute of the day, I haven’t been able to really see too much of it, but I was just not a fan of his. I knew him a little bit. Not very well. I knew him because he was in New York. Not a person that I like. I will say the people that liked them were the Democrats. Michelle Obama loved him. Loved him. Hillary Clinton loved him. And he gave tremendous money to the Democrats, and I guess my question is, will the Democrats be asking for that money back? Because he gave a lot of money to the Democrats, and it’s too bad, but that’s the way it worked out. Yeah, Peter?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","16:51"
"Peter","I just want to follow up on that very quickly, if I can, Mr. President, then I have a question that I wanted to ask you. But just on the Harvey Weinstein situation, this is being viewed as a milestone for the Me Too movement. What message can you as President deliver to women in America who are still afraid to come forward and share their stories of sexual harassment and assault?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","17:50"

"Peter","Can I follow up with my question? I just wanted to follow up on hers quickly. On Coronavirus specifically, Mr. President, 2014 when the Ebola situation was very concerning to so many Americans, you tweeted, “Ebola patient will be brought to the US in a few days. Now I know for sure that our leaders are incompetent.” In all caps, he wrote, “Keep them out of here.” More than 20 Americans have now been brought back to the United States with Coronavirus. By your own measure, does that mean that your government has been incompetent? Are you pleased with the response?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","18:28"
"Donald Trump","No, no. There’s a big difference, in case you don’t know, between Ebola and Coronavirus. Big, big difference. It’s like day and night, and I felt that we should bring them back. They’re Americans. We should bring them back. With Ebola, it’s very explosive. It’s very terrible. We’re making tremendous strides on Ebola with the things that we’re doing, as you know.

"Donald Trump","Let me answer the question. But there’s a tremendous, there’s a vast difference than [inaudible 00:00:19:23], especially in around ’14. Was that ’14 or ’12? And at that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically… People would disintegrate, and we’re still working on Ebola.

"Donald Trump","Excuse me. Yeah, we’re doing a vaccine. We’re doing a lot of things having to do with Ebola. We’re not forgetting about Ebola. That’s a horrible thing. But we have that now very much under control, other than certain parts of the Congo where they are having war and we can’t get in, so we’re still working on that. But as far as what we’re doing with the new virus, I think that we’re doing a great job. I felt that, and the decision was made in Japan, let these Americans come back and we’ll see where they are, but they were immediately put into quarantine. There’s no problem with it whatsoever. They’re all in quarantine. And as you know, I approved two and a half billion dollars for just that purpose and also for working on getting a vaccine.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","19:44"

"Swathi Chandrashekar","How do you define, differentiate, and deal with the love of yours for Indians in India, and Indians love for H-1B visa in America? How do you differentiate this?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","21:08"
"Donald Trump","Yeah, we’re talking about the H-1Bs, and look, the relationship we have, this is not from me. This is from almost everybody that saw it. They say the history of India, which has a long history and a brilliant history in so many different ways, there’s never been a reception given to somebody like was given, and I would like to say for the United States of America. But nobody else that came here got the kind of reception we got. It was 125,000, I think, seats they had yesterday. They were full. You had thousands and thousands of people outside. Prime Minister Modi was telling me thousands of people outside. That’s not uncommon for me, to be honest with you, but when I look at 125,000 seats… And that was an incredible scene yesterday. In addition, all of those people lined up from the airport to the event. It was an incredible thing. Nobody’s ever seen anything like it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","21:23"
"Donald Trump","The ambassador just told me that he’s been in India for a long time. In fact, both ambassadors, their ambassador and the ambassador from India said in 40 years, he’s never seen anything like it, what took place yesterday and earlier than that. But yesterday, they’ve never seen anything like it, so it was a great compliment. It was a great compliment to our country. I’m the leader of the country, but it was a great compliment to our country. But Prime Minister Modi said today they’ve never, ever had any event like that. In fact, they said usually when somebody comes in, they have to look for people to fill up the areas. There was something very special. Look, it’s a massive country in terms of its population, and people just wanted to see. They wanted to pay their respect to the United States, and so I appreciate it. I was a recipient, in a sense, but I was just really representing the country. Yeah, Peter? Yeah?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","22:14"

"Peter","Mr. President, your newly installed personnel director has begun talking with agencies about finding people in the government that are not loyal to you and perhaps moving them on. How large a list do you imagine this will be? Is this a big problem in your mind? Can you describe for us the scale of the problem as you see it?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","23:19"
"Donald Trump","Yeah, I don’t think it’s a big problem. I don’t think it’s very many people. I think we had a whistleblower who was a fake, because if you look at the whistleblower as an example, if you look at his report and then you compare that to the transcripts, it bore no relationship. That was a very sad situation and a lot of time, a lot of time wasted. Although as you will admit, in fact you wrote very nicely, I appreciate it, the poll numbers have gone up very much, but that’s not appropriate to have to benefit by something like that. Then there was supposed to be a second whistleblower. As soon as I released the transcripts, the second whistleblower was gone. Nobody ever heard what happened to the second whistleblower. I’ll ask you. Where is he? Remember, the second was he or she.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","23:37"
"Donald Trump","The second whistleblower was going to happen. It was just a matter of moments. And then I released the real call, the transcripts, which are now 100 percent accurate, even according to Lieutenant Colonel Veneman.

"Donald Trump","We talked a lot about Pakistan. I have a very good relationship with Prime Minister Khan. Very good. We talked about it today at length actually, and Prime Minister Modi, and it’s no question it’s a problem, but it’s a problem they have. They’re working on it. India is, it’s a brave nation too. There’s no pull-back from India, and we just hope. And I said I’ll help. I’ll do whatever I have to do, if I can do that, because my relationship with both gentlemen is so good. But there has been difficulty in Pakistan, and we’re seeing what we can do about it. Anything I can do to mediate, anything I can do to help, I would do.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","25:12"

We discussed it at great length, terrorism, and I think we have some very good ideas. He’s very, very struggling against terrorism. I’ll tell you, Prime Minister Modi, he’s a very religious man, as you know. He’s a very calm man, but he’s actually a very, very strong person. Very tough, actually, when I’ve seen him in action, and he’s got that foremost in his mind, terrorism.

Before coming to India, you said [inaudible 00:26:55] will be later, but of course sometime soon. In the morning, you spoke about energy security and energy deal, and you are already the fifth supplier to our country. You said other sources also. We would like you to elaborate on that. When we are talking energy security and energy deal, what are we looking at, and is nuclear happening?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","26:43"
"Donald Trump","We talked about many things, many, many things. We talked about Iran, we talked about Iraq, we talked about… We were together for two days. I’m going to be with Prime Minister Modi tonight for a state dinner at 7:00. It starts at 7:00, I believe. And we talked about exactly all of the things that you’re talking about. We also talked about tariffs, because as you know, India is probably the highest tariff nation in the world, meaning charging tariffs to outsiders, and I said we have to stop that. We have to stop, at least as it pertains to the United States, and I think we’re understanding each other. With China, we worked a deal, and we worked it because of the tariffs. And I was able to leave the tariffs on. That will take care of phase two. We still have 25 percent and $250 billion, but in the meantime, we’re working with China very much on the virus. We feel that’s something.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","27:17"
"Donald Trump","And I have to tell, I spoke to President Xi the other day. He is so committed to solving that problem. He is working very hard. He is very capable. The country is very capable. And it snuck up on him, but I think he’s going to do well. Now you see it’s going to South Korea, just going to Italy, and it’s going to other places. But I spoke to all of them. They’re all working very, very hard on it. The United States, because of an early decision I made, I made a decision… I believe it was the first time it’s ever been done. We closed the country to certain areas, as you know, and I was criticized for that decision. Now they’re saying it was a good decision.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","28:12"
"Donald Trump","I think it was a good decision, because we have very few people, and you can add to it a few people that we took in because they were Americans. I mean, what are we going to do? And they were almost in-between countries where people weren’t going to take them and they were Americans, but they’re fully quarantined. They call it fully quarantined. We did the right thing. If you were out there, if you were an American and you refused to have any help from your country, these were wonderful people. It wasn’t their fault. But we’re really down to probably 10. Most of the people are outside of danger right now. But we’ve had a very strict line on the people that we’re taking the areas from which we take, and I did it very early. It’s never done before, and I did it early. I think it was a good decision as it turned out.

Can you pledge to the American people that you will not accept any foreign assistance in the upcoming election? And on this idea of a purge in your administration, there was recently the departure of your acting DNI, Joseph McGuire. You replaced him with your Ambassador to Germany, Rick Grenell. Some of your critics have pointed out that Ambassador Grinnell has no intelligence experience.

We’re being charged large amounts of tariffs and you can’t do that. You can’t do that. They understand that that’s where I am and if they want to deal with us, and they will, they’re going to, just like China. Everybody said, “You’ll never make a deal with China.” I made a deal with China. It’s a great deal. They’re going to buy $250 billion worth of product and that’s only a piece of the deal. It’s a large piece. It’s probably 40 to 50%, but it’s an incredible deal.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","32:39"

We have the 25%, they want to get rid of it. Well, with India, India is, I think, the highest, again, I said it before, but the highest tariff. When you deal with India, Harley Davidson has to pay tremendous tariffs when they send motorcycles in here. When India sends motorcycles into the US, there’s virtually no tariff.

It has to be reciprocal. The money you’re talking about is major, but the United States has to be treated fairly. India understands that the relationship is outstanding, but India understands that we’ve had a tremendous deficit for many, many years with India, with everybody, with frankly so many different countries. We’ve had a massive, massive deficit, but a large deficit, $30 billion with India, it’s now down to $24 billion because of what we’ve been doing, but still that’s too high. We shouldn’t have a $24 billion deficit. With other countries, we have more than that. Japan, we’re doing now 40 billion is coming in. A lot of very good deals are being made and they’ll be kicking in toward the end of the year. I would say if the deal happens with India, it will be toward the end of the year.

"Donald Trump","Well, first of all, I’d describe it as incredible because when I looked at the various things, like today when we went … You probably saw where we were. When you look at all of the things that we’ve seen today, when we look at yesterday, the Taj Mahal and other things, in addition to working in between and even during, where we worked very long and hard with representatives from India, most particularly with the Prime Minister, I just think it’s an incredible country. It’s got unbelievable energy. You see that when you come in from the plane. When you see from … I think I can say virtually from the plane to whatever venue we were going to, it was wall-to-wall people. They’ve never seen anything like it. Somebody said it was the greatest greeting ever given to any head of state from any country. Now, India has more people than any other country, a little bit more than China, a little bit, tiny.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","36:30"

"Donald Trump","I think the diplomacy is a diplomacy of great friendship and respect. I think it’s going to all work out very well. I really do. I admire your country tremendously. I respect your Prime Minister tremendously. I think it’s really a diplomacy of friendship. I think it’s going to work out very well. Go ahead, please.

"Speaker 19","Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, the Chinese government recently ejected several Wall Street Journal reporters. What is your administration considering to do in retaliation to that move? Are you considering banning or restricting the access the Chinese journalists, for example, have of the United States?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","38:09"
"Donald Trump","I haven’t really been given a full briefing on that. We’ll get a look at it. We will look at it. It’s something that I don’t like to see. I don’t think it’s fair because we give very good access. Maybe some people would say we give too good. I don’t believe in that. I think we give very good access, so I don’t think it’s fair, but we’ll have a decision made on that relatively soon. Thank you. Good question. Please, go ahead. Go ahead.

"Donald Trump","What’s happening in Venezuela is so sad. People are starving. Here’s a case where a country was wealthy 15 years ago, and very wealthy 20 years ago, very, very wealthy, the wealthiest in all of Latin, South America, the wealthiest, and by far, not even a contest. When you look today, they don’t have water. They don’t have basic food. They have no medicine. It’s incredible what’s happened to Venezuela. No, we’re watching Venezuela very closely. We don’t like it. We don’t like it, not at all.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","39:09"

"Speaker 21","[inaudible 00:39:56] from BBC. There was some back home that were hoping you would raise concerns about some of these policies that Prime Minister Modi has introduced that discriminate against Muslims, and also about a rise in hate crimes here in India, but as someone who-","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","39:56"

"Donald Trump","I had a very powerful answer from the Prime Minister. We talked about religious liberty for a long period of time in front of a lot of people. I had a very, very powerful answer. As far as Muslims are concerned, as he told me, I guess they have 200 million Muslims in India. A fairly short while ago they had 14 million. He said that they were working very closely with the Muslim community.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","40:22"

"Donald Trump","Yeah, I won the travel ban, as you probably know. A lot of people said I lost it. No, I won the travel ban. We used the travel ban where we think there’s, not based on religion, but where we think there’s going to be trouble where we’re looking at certain countries. As you know, we added a few countries onto it, but we won the travel ban and we won it in the Supreme Court. The travel ban is not a thing against Muslims. It’s a thing against areas where we don’t want people coming into our country that are going to cause problems, cause harm, cause death, hurt our people. I feel very strongly about that.

You’re talking about a tremendous country in terms of its heritage, its potential wealth, frankly. Right now they have incredible potential. Economically, they have great potential. Their schooling system is getting better all the time. They’re doing a fantastic job in certain sectors with respect to education. We see it. In the United States, we see it. We have a lot of Indian students coming to our schools. They’re great students. They’ve done fantastically well in our schools, but we have thousands and thousands of people coming from India coming to our colleges in particular schools, but our colleges in particular. Now, India has got a phenomenal future. I mean, you can rarely think of a place that has a better future than India, and highly respected, especially with leadership like Prime Minister Modi. Yeah.

"Speaker 22","Sir, [inaudible 00:43:18] from CNBC TV18 India. American companies have been investing in India for a long, long time.

"Donald Trump","I’m very satisfied because they’re investing tremendous amounts of money. I met Mr. Patel a little while ago. He’s the largest steel person in the world by far. I don’t think there’s even a contest. He’s going to be building a billion dollar plant in Alabama. We had the press, I left them in there, always a risky thing to do, but if you see the … Let’s say we have answered 15 questions. They were talking about how much better it is to work in the United States now in terms of their investment. They have done a [inaudible 00:44:05] … some of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world. I’m not even sure if the media really understood who they were. I knew many of them, certainly heard of all of them. The job they’ve done is incredible, but Mr. Patel, who’s I think the biggest steel company, certainly the biggest steel individual, but I think he’s the biggest steel company by a lot, he’s investing billions of dollars in the United States. He’s only doing it because of what I’ve done to bring back the steel industry.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-new-delhi-news-conference-transcript-february-25","Donald Trump New Delhi News Conference Transcript February 25","43:34"

It’s not just like certain industries that you don’t need. We need it for defense, but he was glowing. One of the reasons he’s spending a billion dollars in Alabama, and more money in other places in the United States, is because we brought it back.
