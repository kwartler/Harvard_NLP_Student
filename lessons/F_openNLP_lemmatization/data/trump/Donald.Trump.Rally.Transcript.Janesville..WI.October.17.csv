"President Donald Trump","Hello, Janesville, and hello, Wisconsin. We love Wisconsin. Look at this crowd. This is massive. But you know we’re having massive crowds all over the place and I’ll tell you what, I look at a poll we’re even in Wisconsin. I don’t think so. With what I’ve done for you, USMCA, we got rid of those horrible… You know what you were being charged? 287% tariff to do business with Canada. I heard about that. I didn’t like that. Your specialty milk people got me. Do you believe it? It was all about specialty milk. That was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. I said, “What do you mean?” Yes, sir, they’re charging us 287%. I said, “No, they’re not any longer.” And we knocked the hell out of it and we got the brand new USMCA. Sleepy Joe can’t do that, it’s not in his vocabulary. He has no idea what we just said. He’s sitting in his basement right now watching us. He has no idea. I hate to do this to you.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:54"
"President Donald Trump","I was a great hair day, and then I heard you at 40 mile an hour winds. I said, “All right, give me the cap.” I don’t do it often. But now I’m looking at that beautiful sight. Is that beautiful? As beautiful as that is, OSHA, as beautiful as that is, I don’t know that I’d want to be those people right in that little corner. Look at that. I think it’s magnificent, but I’d get out of there. But they have no fear, do you? You have confidence in Trump. Yeah, we get good equipment. Good equipment.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","02:58"
"President Donald Trump","It’s great to be back in Wisconsin with thousands of loyal, hard-working Americans. We had a problem, big problem in Texas. We had a surge, they opened it up, it’s all opened up. Arizona, they had a surge. It’s all opened up. Our country is opening. I’ll tell you what, when you look at our numbers compared to what’s going on in Europe and other places, but we’re doing well. We’re going to have one of the best economic years we’ve ever had next year. One of the best we’ve ever had.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","03:35"
"President Donald Trump","17 days from now, we’re going to win the state of Wisconsin, and we are going to win four more years in the running. By the way, early voting begins on Tuesday, so get out and vote. Okay? Now, we’ve had great success in your state and I’ve been very good to you, likewise, with the ships. You build good ships. You know that, right? A lot of other states wanted that contract. I probably lost some states because of it, but we gave you the big contract. Honestly, I went to the yards. It’s incredible what you do. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Six months ago I was saying, “Well, how do you compare with the last one?” I don’t know. That was important. The fact is, this is the single most important election in the history of our country.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","04:02"
"President Donald Trump","Sleepy Joe Biden’s made a corrupt bargain. You saw the bargain he made, in exchange for his party’s nomination, which he shouldn’t have gotten because if Pocahontas got out one day early, I’d be running against Crazy Bernie, which would have been okay, too. I would have had a small but energized base. Now we have a little bit larger base to run against, but there’s zero energy. They’re reporting on it. We’ve got the most energy in the history of politics, and he’s got the least. The most in the history. Biden handed control of his party over to hardcore militant left. The Democrat Party, you once knew no longer exists, it’s now a party of socialists and Marxists and left wing extremists.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","04:57"
"President Donald Trump","If Joe Biden and the Democrat socialists are elected, and I’ve always said, “Our country will never be a socialist country.” They would kill your jobs, dismantle your police departments, and you have a lot of great law enforcement people here today. Thank you. I think we have every single law enforcement group in the country’s endorsed us. Even New York City’s finest. You know they endorsed us, first time they’ve ever endorsed a presidential candidate. It’s big stuff. Chicago, Florida, Ohio. Everybody’s endorsed us. During the debate, I said, “Joe, name one group, law enforcement, that’s endorsed you. Name one.” He was starting to go, “Ahh.” He could breathe. And then, Chris Wallace bailed him out. I said, “Joe, say the words law and order. Say them, Joe.” He wouldn’t do it. I said, “Say the words loiter,” then Chris Wallace bailed him again. But he can’t, because if he says law and order, that means he loses the radical left, which I think he’s losing anyway. But they want to dissolve your borders, raise your taxes, destroy your suburbs. Oh, have I saved your suburbs. The women, they keep telling me about suburban women. I think suburban women liked it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","05:46"
"President Donald Trump","I’ve only saved your house, and frankly, I’ve saved your way of life. I’ve saved the American dream. But they keep saying, “Trump has a problem.” Well, last time they said the same thing. It was even worse. They said I had a problem with women, period. And then the night, that beautiful night four years ago. Was that the greatest of all time? It’s probably the greatest night in the history of television, right? We had so much fun. The tears that were flowing out of pure… Remember the tears? From the totally non-biased anchors. We have another one of them coming up next week, Kristen Welker. She deleted her entire account. I wonder why. I can’t imagine. I’ve known her for a long time. She’s extraordinarily unfair, but that’s all right. We did very well the other night with a person I knew was even more unfair, Savannah. In fact, nobody’s seen Savannah for two days. What happened to Savannah? What happened to Savannah?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","07:14"
"President Donald Trump","They said, “We’d like to give Savannah Guthrie… ” I said, “That’s all right. What difference does it make?” They ask you a question, you give them an answer. Right? It doesn’t matter. But she was sort of jumping out of her seat. She was like flying. She was like, “I told you. I told you. I said, “I don’t care what you told me. What does that mean?” No. We actually got eight plus marks on that. But it was very unfair. Then you watch Sleepy Joe get interviewed by George Stephanopoulos. Nice guy, but he’s a tough guy. He’s tough. I interviewed with him two weeks ago. He was tough. He’s giving these lobs in slow motion, lobs. No, it’s unfair, but you know what? It’s so unfair and we’re president and they’re not, but that’s our own [inaudible 00:08:55]. We are. We are. But they want to fund extreme, late-term abortion. They want to pack… You got to get out and vote. You got to get out and vote. Got to get out and vote.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","08:13"
"President Donald Trump","They want to pack the Supreme Court. You know what that is? It could end up with 16, 1920. They want to put far left judges on the court. They’re going to pick people so far left, and you’ll end up with far left justices like we’ve never had ever before. Our Supreme Court, instead of being what it is now, revered, will end up being nothing. They want to protect criminals and disarm law-abiding Americans. They want to take away your second amendment. If Biden wins the lawless demonstrators in our streets, and you see them all the time, they’re democratic-run. You know I always say Democrat. You know why? Because it sounds worse. They should actually change their name to the Democratic. Democrat sounds lousy. But you know what? That’s actually their name, the Democrat Party. Right? The Democrat Party. So I always say Democrat. They say Democratic. I said, “Why don’t you try changing your name officially?” But they’re lawless demonstrators, and they are, they’re all Democrat-run cities and states, almost every single one of them, and they don’t want to really take care of it. They don’t want to take care of law enforcement. They want it cut.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","09:12"
"President Donald Trump","You see what’s going on in Seattle. First of all, the police who we love, they’re all quitting, they’re all leaving. They’d still be occupying Seattle, except they found out that we were going in the morning that they all raised their hands. The reason they raised their hands is we were going in that morning, we were going to take over. Can you believe it? We’re going to take over the section, the large section of Seattle that these anarchists had. They’re anarchists. That’s all they are.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","10:30"

"President Donald Trump","Law and order is right. In theory, we have to be asked and the Federal Government has to be asked. But we went into Minneapolis, and you know what happened? How long did that take? About 30 minutes? Remember, they formed a line, they formed another line, they were not socially distance, which is very bad. In fact, they were very close. They had the world’s most expensive uniforms on. They had helmets that cost a fortune. There was more computer stuff going on in those helmets. But under the helmets, great brains, and tough. They formed those lines, and then they said, “Okay, let’s go.” This is after two weeks of destruction in Minneapolis. That’s why we’re going to win Minnesota for the first time since 1972, Republican Party. We’re going to win.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","10:59"
"President Donald Trump","Now, it doesn’t hurt that in Minnesota they have Ilhan Omar, who hates our country, who’s broken the law, she’s broken the law.

"President Donald Trump","Nah, we’re going to win. We’re going to win because of what we did with Minneapolis, we saved Minneapolis, and we saved Seattle. Seattle was going real bad. Do you want to know the truth? We’re sort of saving the whole country if you really think about it. That’s why we have spirit, the likes of which I don’t think any campaign has ever had. That’s what’s happened. That’s what’s happened. You know something? I just left Michigan. You know that. Look forward to coming over here. But I just left, and the early voting was going big. It should. It’s supposed to go like 70, 80% to the Democrats, and then we come in with the big red wave. It’s going to be a wave like nobody’s ever seen, because our people want to get out and vote. So they’ll start big heavy when it gets the early voting, but especially on that November third day, we’re going to be swamping it. But here’s what happened. And this is early. So this is early, but still hundreds of thousands of votes.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","12:14"

That was what was supposed to sort of happen, and then you see what happens in the end. And I think we win. But something strange has happened in Michigan. We brought back many car plants, many, many. They hadn’t brought back a plant, I think it’s 42 years, and we brought back many and expansion the car plant. In Michigan, a strange thing has happened. We’re leading substantially in the early voting. What’s that all about? What is that all about? Because something’s happening out there. Look at it. Take a look at this crowd. You can’t see it. As far as the eye can see, you have people. As far as the eye can see. This election day, the people of Wisconsin, and you know what? We win Wisconsin, we win the whole ballgame. What the hell do you think I’m doing here on a freezing night with 45 degree winds. What do you think? Do you think I’m doing this for my health? I’m not doing this for my health.

Obama wouldn’t even endorse him. They ran together, they were [inaudible 00:15:17]. And then even after he won, I didn’t think Obama… It took so long, right? Now I heard that today, they said, “Sir?” “What?” “Well, we have a little problem.” “What?” “Obama is going to campaign for him.” I said, “Well, that’s good news. He campaigned harder than Hillary Clinton did for Hillary, and it just made us stronger. I want him to campaign so much.” I want him to campaign, because we’re going to do even better. But it is true, by issuing Joe Biden, a tremendous defeat at the ballot box. But it’s not Joe Biden. Remember this.

By the way, that’s a record, 56% of the people, and that’s during, and we’re rounding the corner, we got the vaccines, all that, but even without it, we’re rounding the corner. You’ll see it.

If you’re busy, you don’t get sick because you have no time. You don’t think about it. But I wasn’t feeling so good. I wasn’t feeling like your president has to feel. I wasn’t feeling like Superman. All of a sudden, the doctor, we have great doctors. One thing with being president, you got more doctors than any human being. I’m lying down in a bed, I got 12 doctors from Johns Hopkins Hospital, university, great people, all great. Talented, great people. And they love their president. They love their country. But I have doctors, they wanted to touch every single part of my body. I said, “Doctor?” You know what? I didn’t feel great. There’s a drug, it’s Regeneron. It’s a transfusion.

"President Donald Trump","We’ve done a great job. A lot of jobs. It’s just a great job. But the most menacing aspect of the Biden/Harris agenda is their attack of law and order. I was a big part. I came in and I had your sheriff, and what a great guy, Beth, I had your sheriff’s endorsement and a lot of other endorsements in Kenosha. You ever hear of a place called Kenosha? Because if I didn’t get involved, there would be no Kenosha right now. There wouldn’t be one. I wish they called earlier. I wish we could have gotten in a little bit earlier, but that’s okay. Say what you want. I’ll tell you what. I give your governor credit. Unlike Oregon, because we could solve Portland in about, I’d say, 22 minutes. They’re antichrist, they’re wise guys.

We can solve that in two minutes, but they don’t want to do it. At least you governor said, “Let’s go in and let’s solve the problem.” And we solved it. It was late, but better late than never. But we solved and we saved Kenosha. And I want to thank the sheriff and I want to thank the chief, I want to thank all of the law enforcement that was there.

"President Donald Trump","Today, I want to explain to you the threat that their far left plans pose to the safety of your family, your community, and your country. If you give the power to Democrats, the radical left will defund, disband, disarm, and dismantle police departments all across America. Ask if he supports slashing police funding. You saw this last week. He said, “Yes, yes. Absolutely yes.” Honestly, look, he didn’t even understand the question, but that’s what he said. It’s just like fracking, right? He said, “There’ll be no fracking for a year. There’ll be no fracking.” Then he gets lucky. Elizabeth Warren refuses to get out so Bernie can have the nomination. Joe lucks into it on a Super Tuesday, and now he’s standing in Pennsylvania and they want to frack because they have a million fracking jobs and because we’re energy independent and things. He goes from saying for a year and a half, “There will be no fracking.” I wanted to put on a screen, but it was so windy we would’ve needed 15 cranes to hold up the screen. Would have been a giant sail. But we have it. He says no fracking like 18 times.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","20:13"
"President Donald Trump","He then becomes the nominee. Goes to Pennsylvania, which we’re going to win, too. Because in Pennsylvania, I know it, I went to school there, in Pennsylvania, they believe in law and order, and they believe in energy, and they believe in intelligence. Okay? They believe in intelligence. He now goes to Pennsylvania, he gets hit hard, and he all of a sudden says, “I never said that. There will be fracking.” First of all, always follow with these politicians, because I’ve only been doing this for a short while. How the hell did I become president? No, I’ve only been doing it for a short while, but one thing I’ve learned… But I’ve known politics. I’ve been dealing on the other side of politics. One thing, it’s the first thing they say that always matters. And he said it for a long time, along with everybody else in his party, and there’s no way he could not do what he didn’t agree to in the first place.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","21:24"

We will frack.” And the whole place, and not one, see all the fake news media back there, nobody said to him, “But for a year and a half, you said there’d be no fracking, and now you said there’ll be fracking.” Nobody asked him that question.

You got to get only fairer, but you got to get meaner, but you got to get tougher because they play a tougher game. But we have these rebels. And they think they’re hot stuff.

"President Donald Trump","For the entire summer, Biden was silent as radicals, anarchists, arsonists, and vandals rampaged through Democrat-run cities in Minneapolis, Chicago, New York, Seattle, Portland, and other places. Biden called them peaceful protesters. Remember the guy on CNN? He’s standing there and he said, “This is a peaceful …” But his hand is shaking. “This is a peaceful …” I have no idea, it’s Ali Velshi, I have a really good … Ali Velcher, shaved head, right? Shaved his head. I’m thinking about doing that. That way I don’t have to worry about that. I don’t have to worry. No, he shaved it all off, he doesn’t have to worry about … How does it look, darling? How does it look, First Lady? “Darling, you’re the most handsome president.” I said, “First Lady, am I the most handsome president ever?” “Yes, absolutely.” I said, “Who could top me?” Well, she said, “Well, JFK was good looking, but nothing like you.

"President Donald Trump","Earlier this month, rioters laid waste to suburban residential neighborhoods just outside of Milwaukee. Biden will appease the rioters and the looters and the anarchists, and I’m having them arrested. You know what we’re doing. We’re having them arrested. And you know when they knock down statues, you notice that’s very much stopped. Certainly with federal statues. A little thing happens, it’s amazing how quickly it stopped. They go to jail for a period of 10 years. It’s amazing. They were getting all set to take down the incredible statue of Andrew Jackson right by the White House, right? And I said, “We can’t let that happen.” And I’ll tell you what. The police went out and they charged. It was an incredible thing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","28:26"
"President Donald Trump","Because today, everyone wants to be so damn politically correct. The police are afraid if they touch somebody or speak to somebody rudely, there’ll be destroyed, their pension will be gone, their family will be gone. No, we got to protect our police, we’ve got to take care. They got to be fair. And you’re going to have problems and you’re going to have mistakes. And people will choke. They’ll choke, they have a decision to make. They have a quarter of a second sometimes to make. And you’ll have some bad cops. And we got to do something about those bad cops. And that happens. But 99.9, I mean, they’re the most incredible people and they keep us safe. Right? They keep us safe. They keep us safe.

"President Donald Trump","This year, more than 1000 law enforcement officers have been viciously attacked. Nobody talks about that. Nobody talks about that. Several police officers have been very, very brutally murdered. You saw a month ago with the two sitting in a car. And I mean, that’s just a horrible thing. The anti-police rhetoric of Joe Biden and the Democrat party is really what causes a lot of this too. But it puts police officers in harm’s way. It really puts them in harm’s way. We can’t let that happen. Biden referred to police as the enemy, he just referred, the enemy, quote, quote, the enemy. And vilified them as an oppressive racist force. I mean, this guy has gotten just beaten up. He doesn’t believe that. I really don’t believe … I shouldn’t say that. But I don’t believe he believes it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","29:52"

I said, “Mike, that was just too easy.” oh, she was just terrible. She was terrible. I mean, I couldn’t believe he picked her. And I’ve said it a lot.

"President Donald Trump","Well, don’t forget. We have done more than any administration in the first three and a half years in the history of our country. We’ve rebuilt our military, we’ve cut more regulation than any other administration by a factor of a lot. And we all did this. We have more federal judges by the end of the first term than any other administration. In fact, percentage wise, the only one that has more, there’s only one president that has more percentage wise, not the number. Because we’ll have 300, maybe even more than that by the end of the first term. But there’s only one president that has a higher percentage than I have. Do you know who that is? George Washington. Give him a hat. Give him a Make America Great Again hat. We’ll say, “Make America Great Again” hat. Again, again. We made it great again and now we’re going to make it great again because we had to close it up, save two million lives, and now we’re opening it up and we’re doing record numbers.

"President Donald Trump","Joe’s running mate and America’s most liberal Senator, Kamala Harris, recently urged their supporters to donate to a fund that bailed out the rioters that did so much harm and even physical damage to people, but damage in Minneapolis. And they wanted to bail them out of jail. And she was heading up a group to get them out of jail. And including a really bad attempted cop killer. He attempted killing a policeman. 13 members of Biden’s staff donated to the same fund. By the way, they talk about fundraising, right? I’m good at fundraising. I could be the greatest fundraiser in history. I’m the president of the United States. I’m a really smart guy like you are. But I’ll tell you what, think of this. Think of this. If I wanted to pick up a phone and call Wall Street, say the FIG firms, say, “Yeah, I got to raise X dollars.” They’ll do it, every one. I mean, it’s so easy. It’s so easy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","32:20"
"President Donald Trump","I could have more money. The problem is if you do that, what happens is when they call you in two months, three months, four months because they need something, you got to take their call and you got to do it. So Biden is raising a lot of money because they’re promising all these things to all these people. Now, I have a much better platform because I am the president, right? I could raise money. And then the fake news goes out and says, “You know what? We’re doing great. We’re doing great on the small donors. The small donors, like $61 a piece and stuff.” But I could raise more money than anybody in the history of politics. But I don’t want to call these people and say, “Do me a favor, the head of Goldman Sachs.” I don’t want to say, “Do me a favor.” All these people. Nobody could ever raise money like me. I just don’t want to do it because it puts us all, meaning us, I did this for us, not for me.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","33:21"
"President Donald Trump","Believe me. I didn’t do it for me. I lost a fortune. This job has cost me billions and billions of dollars, billions. They don’t like to say that. Billions of dollars. And yet, if a man from Kuwait comes up and stays at one of my hotels for $259. 13, takes a room. Next day, “Trump takes Arab as a guest in one of hotels.” I mean, billions I lost. And that’s okay because I’m doing something that’s the most important thing I’ve ever done. I don’t care. There are a lot of rich people around. What the hell difference does it make? But I’ve lost billions. And I never talk about it. They never talk about it. So I get paid, I guess, $400,000, $450,000. And I give up my salary. I don’t get it. You don’t read that. You don’t read it. Because you know what? It’s not good for them to say that. And I don’t talk about it. But tonight, I’ll talk about it. So I get the highest salary because you’re the president.

Can you imagine if they wanted to go to the Middle East and do jobs all over the place? I’d have hotels being built in every city, in every country in the world. And I have great kids and they’re ambitious kids. They’d like to do it. I say, “You can’t do it.” And by the way, there’s no legal reason you can’t do it. But there is a big reason, psychologically. You can not go to Saudi Arabia and all these different places that we protect and we do all these things and that buy a lot of our planes and a lot of our everything, you can’t allow them.

"President Donald Trump","The Democrat party’s war on cops is driving police officers to leave their jobs in record numbers. No one is hurt more by the left wing crusade against law enforcement than African-Americans. They’re hurt the most. And you look at it and you know it. Last year, and by the way, large percentages of our police men and women are African-Americans. It’s a Black community. Last year, in just four Democrat-run cities, over 1000 African-Americans were murdered as a result of violent crime. This year, murders in Democrat cities have increased by more than 30%. And we’d help them. We’d help them. We want to help them. We say, “Call.” I say, ” Call.” They don’t want to call. More than half of the victims are African-Americans. Joe Biden and the left ignore these American victims. I never will. We’re never going to ignore them. We have done more for the Black community than any president with the exception of Abraham Lincoln. It’s true.

Bush couldn’t do it, none of them could do it then. And it was desperately needed. Criminal justice reform, I did it. Prison reform, we did it. We did things nobody … How about opportunity zones? Right. So great for Hispanic, so great for the Black community, the jobs. We worked on that with a great senator from South Carolina, Tim Scott. Great senator. Historically Black colleges and universities. You went to one. Oh, which one did you go to? I love them. Very good, that’s a good one. I don’t know if I could have gotten in, that’s too good.

And the first year I saw them, I thought it was routine and they were up because they needed money for the colleges. I said, “Oh, that’s interesting.” Second year, I said, “What are you doing back here?

He said, “They make us come back every year.” Obama never did it. Obama never did it. And I said, “So wait, here’s what we’re going to do. We’re going to get you long-term funding.” And here’s what I did. I got them more money than they were asking for. And now for a 10 year period.

I’m the president of the United States. And I would often say, I meet people, and these are incredible, like the Gold Star families.

This is in almost all case. I say, “So tell me what happened.” “Sir, my daughter was a helicopter pilot and she was so good. She was so good, sir. And she was shot down, sir, in Iraq.” And then they tell me what happened and how brave and how great. And I can’t say, “Do me a favor.” You just can’t do that.

They over-sample Democrats by 28%. Trump is down five. I said, “Yeah, but you’re interviewing mostly Democrats.” You ever see that? I guess there must be a legal reason why they have to put it, but they over-sample by 18% ,20%, 21%. How about last election? So I was down in all nine places that I had to win. That wasn’t a good feeling. Wake up, how are we doing? “Well, you’re down at all nine places.” By the end of the evening, I won all nine places. Think of it.

But the spirit, we have much more spirit now than we ever had four years ago. And we had a record. A record. But you know what? The media is more corrupt and they’re worse. It’s not really Biden.

He’d mentions Right to Try, that’s where a person is terminally ill and they can’t get a medicine that looks real good, but it hasn’t been approved because it has to go through this long process, which we’ve cut in half by the way. But they can’t get, so now they sign a document and it was very complicated, but not for me, it wasn’t complicated. I said, “You take the liability away.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","51:04"
"President Donald Trump","But we had problems with the insurance companies because they didn’t want… We had problems with everybody, including the country. They didn’t want to get sued. So people would go all over the world, if they had some money, if they didn’t have money, they’d go home and they just die. And now if we have something that may work, but it’s two years away, three years away, they sign just a quick waiver. And we’ve had Right to Try. And Ron, I don’t know if you know, the success rate. It’s been unbelievable, the number of people. This isn’t just trying. We have kept people alive and healthy and well and fully recovered. It’s a very great thing. And I could never understand it, because for years I said, “Why wouldn’t they give somebody who’s terminally ill the drug?” And because they say, “We don’t want to get sued,” because they’ll get sued. The family will sue or something happens.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","52:08"
"President Donald Trump","I mean, I understand it all. But we got it done, they sign a waiver and we got it done. And the effects… And you know what else happened? A side effect that nobody thought too much about. These companies that are trying to prove that their drug works, I’ll tell you, if it works there, it works everywhere. It’s incredible. And they’re able to be able to speed it up, where they speed them up because we’ve had some unbelievable stories. One in particular that I know, a young lady who spoke at the national convention, Republican National Convention, but the success rate has been incredible. So I want to thank you for that. You’re right, you’re one of the real authors of it. We want to also thank Glenn Grothman. Glenn has been incredible.

I’ll tell you, he has a big future. Thank you very much for being here. And everybody knows Darin LaHood. Darren, thank you. Great job. Warriors. Warriors, you really are. You’re all great in Wisconsin. You’re producing good in Wisconsin. What can I tell you? The Wisconsin GOP Chairman, Andrew Hitt. Where’s Andrew? Thank you, Andrew. How are we doing Andrew? Going to win this state? We got to win it. We got to win it. By the way, I wanted to say before Ron Johnson interrupted me… So who is a Republican here, just raise your hand? Okay. That’s a lot. Seriously, don’t worry about your hand, we all love you. Who is a Democrat here?","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","53:46"
"President Donald Trump","Republicans, you better get out there and win, huh? We really do. No, we appreciate it. We have a lot of them over there too. We have a lot of Democrats, but we really do appreciate it. Because ultimately, we’re looking for the same thing. We’re looking for unity. We’re looking for one country. And the question was asked a week ago and they said, “What about bringing the country together, because I want that?” And I said, “We were there. Before the China virus hit us, we were there.” And we were getting calls because the success was bringing us together as a country. We had the greatest employment numbers. We had the greatest African-American Hispanic-American, Asian-American, women, people with a diploma, people without a diploma, people that graduated first in their class at MIT, everybody. We had 160 million people working. We never had anything like it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","54:54"
"President Donald Trump","And I’m telling you, I bet it was true with you guys, we were getting calls from people that you would least suspect and the country was coming together. Then we got hit by the China virus and it was back to the drawing boards. But the country was coming together, and it’s going to come together. It’s going to be a success. And next year we’re going to have the most successful year economically, I think, with what we’ve done. I also want to introduce the Republican candidate for Senate from the State of Illinois, Mark Curran. Mark, great. I heard you were here, good. Good, good. I like it. [crosstalk 00:56:30] That’s great. Good luck. I hear you’re doing well, Mark. Good luck. Great to have you. Thank you very much. I’ll tell you what, Illinois could use a new governor.

"President Donald Trump","They got to open up that state. They got to open up that state. Kids have to get back to school. You know Barron had it, right? They said Barron, Barron Trump, my boy, my very tall young boy. He’s very tall, but Barron Trump had it. And they said, “Sir, he tested positive.” And like about nine seconds later, “How’s Barron doing?” “Oh, he’s all better.” No, young people, they have, we hate to admit it, they have a very strong immune system, incredibly strong. We have to get back to school. Have to get back to school. You watch what happens. On November 4th, they’ll all say, “All right. Now, everybody…” They’re only doing this for politics. I really believe that, because they want the numbers to look as bad as possible. So whether it’s your state or whether it’s an Illinois or whether it’s New York or whether it’s Michigan. Hey, we won the case in Michigan. The courts have now forced her. They said it was unconstitutional what she was doing.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","56:49"
"President Donald Trump","The only person in the whole state that was allowed to have fun and go bowling and play tennis and do whatever he want, was the governor’s husband, right? Her husband was free to do whatever he wanted. But other than that, it was like a prison she was operating. This election is a choice between a Trump super recovery and a Biden depression. And they’re going to raise your taxes substantially, like quadruple. He’s the only candidate… All my life I’ve been involved in politics, never from the side. But a few years ago I said, “Let’s give it a shot,” but I’ve always been around. This is the only time in my life. I always heard it was good to cut taxes. I said, “How do you say we’re giving a massive tax increase to everybody?” And it’s everybody, because you’re getting thousands of dollars a year from my tax cuts. We gave the greatest, the biggest tax cut in history and he wants to end the Trump tax cut.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","57:52"

But he wants to end it, and don’t forget child tax credit. That’s a thousand dollars for every child. So he’s going to end all that. So he was going to end it, ” We’re going to end…” He didn’t realize that the middle income people are getting a tremendous tax cut. And if you add energy to it, because they’ll drive energy through the roof. They want to end fossil fuel. They’re going to end fracking. 100% they’re going to end fracking. I mean, this guy goes around, “We’re going to end fracking,” for a year and a half. Then he lucks out, gets the nomination. Because Pocahontas refused to do what she should have done, if she believes really in his philosophy of being a socialist, right? And he gets it. And as soon as he gets it, he says, “No, no we’re going to frack.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","58:45"

There’s never been anything like that. So if you vote for me, you’ll have the greatest… If he gets in, he’s going to raise your taxes like crazy. If he gets in… And it’s not him, again, it’s his people that tell him what to do. If he gets in, you will have the greatest depression in the history of this country, your stocks will go to hell. Everyone thinks, “Stocks, oh, it’s rich people.” Everybody owns stocks. You have 401ks. Who has a 401k here? That’s a lot of people. Okay. Are you practically at your all time high, right? Your 401ks will be like wastepaper basket stuff. There’ll be right there on the floor. You’ll have a depression the likes of which we’ve never seen, with the possible exception of 1929, because I don’t think it gets much worse than that.

"President Donald Trump","Regulations, we cut more regulations than any administration in history. And regulation may be more important, in terms of jobs and everything, then even the biggest tax cut. It’s the biggest tax cut in history. And I think the regulation cut, which is more than any president’s done, no matter they were eight years or in one case more, it doesn’t matter. Our regulation cutting was the biggest. He wants to put them all back. That means all these companies that moved to America, that moved to the United States, that came here because of lower taxes, because of all of the things that we’ve done. It used to take 18 to 21 years to get a highway built, to get a highway approved. We’ve got it down to two years. And let me tell you, it may not make it. If it doesn’t work environmentally or if it’s unsafe, but at least you’re going to know. We’re trying to get it to one year, by the way and we’re close to getting it.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:00:35"
"President Donald Trump","But it used to take, I mean, we have highways for 20 years, they’ve been trying to get approvals. And then after it gets approved, it’s totally different and it costs hundreds of times more money. If you vote for me, prosperity will surge. Normal life will fully resume. And the next year will be the greatest year economically in the history of our country. Joe Biden would terminate our recovery with a draconian unscientific lockdown. I mean, not that you’re already in it. And he’ll keep Wisconsin locked up, locked down and closed for business. Biden will shut down the country, delay the vaccine and prolong the pandemic. And companies will be afraid to invest in Wisconsin, if you have this happen, and our country. But you have a Democrat governor, I don’t know him but he’s a nice guy probably.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:01:29"
"President Donald Trump","But I will tell you, companies, big companies, very strong companies, companies like as an example, Foxconn, they don’t want to invest with these people. They don’t want to invest. They don’t have any security. They don’t have any… They don’t want to invest. I get in, companies like that will put more money in then they even promised. But they’re very concerned, I mean, they have to have the right climate. So we are going to do things with Wisconsin, but we’re going to do things with this country, like honestly has never even been done before and people will come together because of success. So we’re delivering a safe vaccine very soon and a rapid recovery. Biden’s plan will crush Wisconsin. My plan will crush the virus and will make Wisconsin greater than ever before. That’s what’s going to happen. It’s going to happen fast.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:02:23"
"President Donald Trump","You have a spike, you have a surge. But if you remember it, two months ago, Florida had a big surge. It’s now gone. The numbers are very down. It’s totally open. Texas had a very big surge and now it’s down. If you look at Arizona had a big, big surge, all great governors and it’s down. It’s down to all low numbers, really low numbers. And you’re going to have the same thing, but you got to open up. You got to open up, got to get the place going. Joe Biden is the living embodiment of the corrupt political class, that enriched itself while draining the economic life and soul from our country. I mean 47 years, and he just says, “Well, I should have done this or that.” I said, “Joe, you were here for 47 years.

I said, “Joe, you could have done something for the last 47 years.” Joe Biden shipped away your jobs, shut down your factories, and you know it very well, you got to hit hard here, threw open your borders and ravaged our cities while sacrificing American blood and treasure in endless wars that were ridiculous in countries that you’d never even heard of. And they’re all coming back. They’re all coming back. Got a lot of them, most of them are back. Joe Biden is and always has been a corrupt politician. I hate to say it.

China will own… They’re paying us billions and billions of dollars a year. I charged them billions. They never paid us 25 cents. I gave $28 billion to the farmers, many of them right here, 28. 12 and 16, two years. I said to Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Agriculture, great guy, “How much have we been targeted for our farmers by China?” He said, “Sir, two years ago, $12 billion and last year, 16. 28 billion.” I said, “That’s good. We’re going to target them.” We took $28 billion. We had tens of billions left over that went to the treasury, our treasury by the way. Our treasury, right into our treasury, not into China’s treasury, our treasury.

"President Donald Trump","I also cut the tariffs between Canada, what they were doing to you with 287% tariffs. So I’m not just running against Biden. I’m running against the left wing media, the big tech companies. But if you think about it, the Democrats and the media are one in the same. When you look at MSDNC and you look at fake news, CNN, then you look at the fake New York Times, the failing New York Times… And the good news is, look… Well, I don’t even call it good news. But when someday I leave, whether it’s in four years, eight years, 12 years, 16 years… Now the story tomorrow will be with the fake news, “He is a fascist he wants to take over…” No. No. But when, at some point, I leave, they’re all out of business. They’re going to go out of business. They know it too. That’s why I expect someday they’re going to all get together and say, “Let’s endorse him, because he’s done a really good job.” And they know that.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:05:59"

They oppose school choice, so important is school choice, while sending their families to the best private schools. They attack the Second Amendment, while employing armed guards for themselves. They want to get rid of your Second Amendment. It’s not going to happen with me, I promise. I don’t think they’ll get Ron Johnson on their side. Ron, can I have your pledge please? I will protect… Okay. We got Ron Johnson. Fellas, we have your votes. In 2016, Wisconsin voted to fire this corrupt and decrepit political establishment.

We have $13 billion coming to help our farmers, in addition to all of the money that China paid our farmers, including Wisconsin’s incredible dairy farmers. How’s the dairy business, right? Anybody here do specialty milk. People don’t realize though, specialty milk are very important. It’s a very small part, but it was like the straw that broke the camel’s back. Because I met with these guys and what they were doing, ripping you off on the big stuff, specialty milk. And anybody do specialty milk? I don’t know. You know what? It’s so small, but when I heard it, it was like 287%. Well, those days are over.

We have it all over the place.” And if they ever manage their forests in California and other places, you wouldn’t have these forest fires. And part of that is cutting wedges. You have to cut wedges and all that stuff. And so we have so much timber. And I don’t know, I guess we’re just nice people, doing it from other lands, right? But we’re doing good with our timber, we saved our timber jobs. If Joe Biden gets in, the radical left will shut down Wisconsin timber production forever. They don’t want to let you touch a tree. If you happen to touch a tree, they want to put you in jail for the rest of your life. I also issued brand new regulations to ensure American workers are first in line for jobs.

That wall, we’re doing 10 miles a week and we’ll be hitting over 400 miles within a period of a couple of weeks. And it’ll be finished very soon. And by the way, Mexico is paying for the wall, you do know. So finally, they said, “Well, all right, he’s built the wall. Let’s not talk about the wall anymore.” So now, whenever they go, “But Mexico is not paying.” No, no. Mexico is paying. We’re putting a charge at the border and Mexico is paying us for the wall. But Mexico has been great to us, because they have 27,000 soldiers all along our Southern border. And I want to thank the President of Mexico, who happens to be a great guy.

There aren’t a lot of people that would be good at that job. We have to respect those people that protect us like this. Immigration security is national security. Remember that? And we have to have borders. A nation without borders is not a nation. We don’t have a nation.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:16:05"
"President Donald Trump","So on behalf of the United States, I’d like to extend my sincere, really sincere condolences to a friend of mine, President Macron of France, where they had just yesterday, a vicious, vicious, Islamic terrorist attack beheading, and just a teacher near Paris, beheading. A horrible thing. And they’ve apprehended nine people, who knows. But we’ve been very, very strong on radical Islamic terrorism. And we do have a ban. People said, “Oh, that’s such a terrible thing.” Remember I put the ban o.n and then we got sued and we lost, lost, and then we wanted the United States Supreme Court.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:16:34"
"President Donald Trump","We’ve also invested and France is having a hard time and Macron’s a great guy, and I just want to say whatever we can do. We’ve also invested 2.5 trillion with a T, trillion dollars in the U.S. military, which was totally depleted when we took office. Including major contracts to build new warships that saved the historic shipyard right here in Marinette Marine in Wisconsin. We gave you billions of dollars.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:17:16"
"President Donald Trump","A lot of states wanted that contract, I gave it to you. And I came to Marinette about three months ago. And they do a great job. But a lot of people wanted that. A lot of states wanted it. And it’s okay. I’m going to lose those states, but that’s all right. Just remember that, Wisconsin. But we gave it, it’s a lot of jobs. It’s actually a very big contract that gets bigger, but they do fantastic work. I looked at what they were doing. Incredible talented people. And you would have lost that ship yard. That’s a big yard. You would have lost it, but we saved it. We’ve done plenty.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:17:48"
"President Donald Trump","We launched the first new branch of the U.S. Armed Forces in nearly 75 years, the Space Force. I withdrew from the last administration’s disastrous, $150 billion for nothing. Plus 1.8 billion in cash Iran nuclear deal. If and when we win, if we win, the first call I’m going to get is from the head of Iran. And he’s going to say, “Let’s make a deal.” Iran their economy. Their GDP went down 27%. They are dying to make a deal. I said, “Look, you want to really see the election because you’re not going to be in a position. You got to see the election.” The first call I get will be them.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:18:21"
"President Donald Trump","And then I’ll tell you the other calls, but I better not, because I’m going to just make the deal harder if I do. But plenty of other nations are going to be calling because they’re going to want to make deals. I recognize the true capital of Israel and opened the American embassy in Jerusalem. I also recognize… By the way, every president for many, many presidents, right, every single president said they were going to do that. And you went back how many presidents? Many, many, many decades. And they all said they were going to do it. And they never did it because I’ll tell you what it wasn’t easy.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:19:07"
"President Donald Trump","Once I got to office the pressure put on your president not to do it was incredible. And I told the story, I didn’t take phone calls. I got calls from kings and presidents and prime ministers. Not to do it. “Don’t do it, sir. Don’t do it. We don’t want you to do it.” You know? “It’s going to be horrible if you do it, sir, it’ll cause problems.” Then finally I said, “I’ll tell you what, who’s calling?” “A king.” “Who’s calling?” “An emir.” “Who else is calling?” “Prime ministers, presidents”. In one case, a queen. I was thinking about taking her call, but I [inaudible 01:20:17].","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:19:42"
"President Donald Trump","And I said, “No, no, no. What are they calling about?” “They want to talk you out of moving the capital of Israel to Jerusalem.” I said, “Really?” “It’s very important.” “Okay. Tell them that. I’m going to call them back on Thursday.” I had the press conference on a Tuesday. So I said, “Tell them, I’ll call them back on Thursday. I look forward to talking to them.” I then announced that we were doing it. And we had Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. And then I called back the heads of all these countries. “Yes, King. What could I do for you, President of the United States?” “Well, I wanted to talk to you about Israel, but it’s already been announced.” “Oh gee, I wish I got to you a little bit soon. I’m sorry.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:20:19"
"President Donald Trump","No, it’s much, much easier than, like what do we need? So I got back to them. They were over disappointed. You know what? We opened and it was going to cost anywhere from a billion to $2 billion. And I said to my very talented, who was one of the greatest lawyers in New York, David Friedman, a great lawyer. I said, “David, see if you can get a piece of land cheap or a piece that we already own.” Because they want to spend $2 billion to build this thing. I said, “We can do it cheaper.” Calls me back two days later, “Sir, we have a piece of land with a building on it. I think we can renovate it for $350,000. It’ll be nicer than the one they want to build.” So we did it for 350. I actually first time in my life. I said, “David, I’ve never said this before, it sounds too cheap. Make it 500,000.”","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:21:02"
"President Donald Trump","So instead of spending a billion to two billion, probably would’ve never got built. You can imagine the cost overruns everything else. And this was a better location, a bigger piece of land, a better view, better everything, safer, better part. We got there early. We have the best land, right? That’s why I said it. I said, “David, no matter where you are, we were always there first.” Right? If you want a good building by a post office, it’s always there. They were always there first. But we were there first. I said we must… And he said, “We have a great piece of land. The building, we fixed it.” Was an empty building and it’s beautiful. And we use Jerusalem stone, which is a complicated thing. But I won’t tell you about a very expensive, except if you happen to be in Jerusalem. And it’s a beautiful embassy and it’s opened and now we have the capital and I’ll tell you something. Think of it. Every single president, you go back during their campaign. They used to campaign on it and nobody had the guts to do it, but we did it. Oh, look at you. We did it. Right? Did I do it? And we opened the embassy three months later. Can you believe that? Instead of 10 years later, we wouldn’t have that thing open for 20 years. I also recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan Heights. 52 years, they worked on it. I got it done in about two hours. And instead of endless war in the Middle East, we’re forging peace without blood all over the sand.","https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-rally-transcript-janesville-wi-october-17","Donald Trump Rally Transcript Janesville, WI October 17","01:21:47"

"President Donald Trump","And now the Democrats are pushing the most far-left agenda ever put forward by a presidential nominee.

Crazy Bernie. And surge refugee admissions by over 700%. This is agreed to. Opening the flood gates to radical Islamic terrorism. How’s France doing? Not too good.

"President Donald Trump","Biden wants to ban school choice, the most important thing, school choice. And he wants to end charter schools, which have been so successful.
